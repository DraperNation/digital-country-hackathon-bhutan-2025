Executive Summary
Optimistic growth outlook driven by the commissioning of PHP-II and the accelerated
hydropower development
Bhutan’s economy is expected to grow by 8.93 percent, nearly doubling from 4.97 percent in 2024.
This growth is mainly fueled by the commissioning of Punatsangchu-II Hydropower Project (PHP-
II), increased tourist arrivals and construction of Khorlochuu and Dorjilung. Further, government
interventions through the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP) are expected to boost output of
agriculture and manufacturing sectors. However, the growth projection remains vulnerable to risks
such as external shocks and climate change, mainly electricity generation.
Labor mobility is expected to gradually transition from the lower to higher productivity sectors.
Workers are expected to move to the industry sector, which is projected to grow by 19.48 percent,
primarily driven by the expansion of hydropower and construction. Agriculture is also projected
to grow gradually, reflecting ongoing structural changes. The services sector, the other driver of
economic growth, is expected to grow at 4.34 percent primarily driven by increased tourist arrival
and length of stay mainly attributed to the ongoing airfare subsidy program. Nevertheless, this
sector is highly vulnerable to external shocks and the global geopolitical uncertainties, including
the emerging trade-war, which compounds the risk.
On the demand side, aggregate demand is projected to rise, primarily driven by strong public
investments. With the increased collaboration between the public and private sector, this is also
likely to increase private investment. Consumption, on the other hand, is expected to rise as
government spending increases. However, due to weak supply-side, the external imbalance
remains a concern. To mitigate the risks, efforts should be directed towards addressing the
declining capital productivity and increasing domestic production through efficient allocation and
utilization of both public and private resources. To boost the private sector, it is important to
deregulate the domestic market and ensure that fiscal and monetary policy measures align with
long-term economic growth and stability.
Expansionary fiscal policy aims to rectify structural challenges amidst declining fiscal
multiplier
Despite the gradual increase in domestic revenue and external grants, Bhutan faces persistent fiscal
challenges. The government’s expansionary fiscal policy under the 13th FYP focuses on
stimulating economic growth and addressing the structural issues, while targeting a fiscal deficit
of 3 percent of GDP on average. This fiscal target is supported through higher revenue collection
but it remains insufficient to keep pace with rising expenditures. The rising expenditure is financed
through external grants and borrowings, which continues to fund capital investments and the
budget is balanced through issuance of domestic bonds. Therefore, long-term fiscal sustainability
2
hinges on broadening the tax base and consolidating expenditures, which are also crucial steps to
reduce reliance on external support and maintain macroeconomic stability.
The Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) projects an increase in recurrent expenditure
mainly on account of statutory payments such as interest rates, and pay and allowances. On the
other hand, revenue remains concentrated on income tax and hydropower earnings. GST
implementation is expected to increase revenue collection by 2 percent of GDP, but for the policy
to be business friendly and reduce administrative cost, it is important to revisit and reduce the
number of exemptions and Excise Equalization Tax (EET).1 Nevertheless, capital expenditure
inefficiencies at planning and implementation remains a concern. Fiscal multiplier analysis shows
that recurrent expenditure spending has a higher impact on GDP as compared to capital
expenditure, indicating capital expenditure inefficiencies. Further, the capital output ratio of 4:1
highlights that the economy needs 4 units of capital to produce only 1 unit of output. To ensure
effectiveness of government investments, it is important to enhance expenditure planning and
improve capital utilization.
Substantial government investments and concentrated credit risks characterized by high
NPL could potentially exert pressure on reserves.
Bhutan’s monetary and financial sector faces mounting challenges due to global economic
uncertainties and domestic policy constraints. Overall inflation remains stable, however non-food
inflation fell by 0.6 percent, signaling weakening consumption demand. The money supply (M2)
is projected to grow by 14.57 percent and 12.31 percent in FY 2024/25 and 2025/26, respectively,
increasing inflationary risks and reserves depletion. Liquidity in the market remains a concern,
making reinstatement of liquidity management tools essential for stability. Despite RMA’s
accommodative policy stance, reliance on administrative measures, moratoriums and further credit
deferment could potentially subdue the growth outlook.
Credit remains heavily concentrated in the housing sector, which also has the highest Non-
Performing Loans (NPLs) in volume. In terms of ratio, the transport sector has the highest NPL
ratio of 13.11. Such a trend could potentially cause systemic financial risk, necessitating stronger
credit risk management. Further, the capital market remains underdeveloped, with market
capitalization standing at about 21 percent of GDP, which again is dominated by financial
institutions accounting to about 74 percent of the capital market. For capital market development,
it is essential to ease access to avail the services. To foster financial resilience, the financial sector
must diversify credit allocation and reduce interest rate spread, in tandem with the economic
policies initiated by the government to ensure long-term economic growth.

Decline in exodus rate and increased remittance helps reduce the current account deficit
projection.
The current account deficit is projected to decline to 11.81 percent of GDP due to decline in service
imports and increase in remittances. The decline in services imports is mainly attributed to decline
in exodus rate, which could be attributed to positive expectation created by the visionary Gelephu
Mindfulness City (GMC) initiatives. However, the trade imbalances persist, with anticipated
increase in imports from India, as a result the Indian Rupee (INR) reserves are projected to decline.
On the financial side, improvement in inflows is expected on account of government borrowings
rather than investments inflows.
While Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remains low, regulatory improvements and deregulation
of the domestic market combined with slight relaxation in capital controls could enhance
productivity and economic diversification. While deregulation is important to attract investment,
addressing transfer pricing issues to ensure FDI contributes to economic growth is essential.
Boosting productivity to strengthen exports, managing external debt, and attracting FDI to capture
the growing middle-income market in South-Asia will be crucial to address Bhutan’s weakening
competitiveness in the region.
Structural transformation of the labor market has not yet translated into widespread
productivity gains.
Bhutan’s economy has been transitioning from agriculture to industry and services sector since
1990. However, the premature deindustrialization of the industry sector and oscillating services
sectors resulted in subdued productivity. As a result, the labor market transformation has been
gradual with the agriculture sector still employing about 41 percent of the total employment in
2024, while contributing only about 12.63 percent to GDP, highlighting the productivity gap. This
is followed by the public sector, employing about 18 percent and contributing only about 10.62
percent to GDP. Considering the low productivity, the youth unemployment remains persistently
high at 19.1 percent, but expected to decline marginally in coming years. The slow productivity
growth has resulted in increased household debt in recent times, not on account of investment but
rather consumption, which could be a concerning trend.
Nevertheless, households in Bhutan experienced growing social progress with improved living
standards bolstered by improved literacy rate and life expectancy. As a result, overall poverty in
the country has been declining. However, the poverty in rural areas still remains high, calling for
targeted interventions rather than blanket expenditure programs. With increased social progress
comes the trade-off of declining fertility rate. The declining fertility rate (1.7), which is below the
replacement rate of 2.1, with increased life expectancy is expected to push Bhutan into an aging
society, while still remaining a lower middle-income country. This is likely to cause an increase
in national burden for future generations and subdue future economic growth unless effective
policy interventions are implemented to mitigate the long-term economic and social challenges.

The industrial sector shows signs of deindustrialization and fragmentation.
The industrial sector faces significant structural hurdles that prevent it from reaching its full
potential. The sector’s development is lopsided, with a heavy reliance on resource-based industries
such as hydropower and mining. While these resource-based industries generate substantial gross
output, they offer limited positive spillovers for stimulating growth in other sectors. Consequently,
manufacturing remains less developed than in neighboring countries, with manufacturing share to
GDP remaining well below levels observed in South Asian economies and showing signs of
premature deindustrialization – a worrying trend where manufacturing shrinks before reaching
typical levels in advanced economies.
Bhutan’s limited domestic market, combined with difficult terrain and developing infrastructure
restricts economies of scale, hindering large-scale industrial production and increasing costs. The
industrial base is fragmented, dominated by Cottage and Small-scale Industries (CSI) (95.34
percent), many of which lack the technology, capacity, and access to funding needed for large-
scale production, specialization or automation. This fragmentation, coupled with strong
competition among Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) hinders scaling and
expansion. Moreover, these small-scale players face intense competition from large-scale
enterprises that dominate the market segments (above 90 percent of market share is held by large-
scale enterprises). This underscores the need for a comprehensive industrial development policy,
similar to those employed by advanced economies, to guide strategic interventions and foster
sustainable growth to revitalize the manufacturing sector.
Enhancing the productivity and efficiency of SOEs for accelerated economic growth
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), with combined assets of Nu. 371,868.974 million in 2024, plays
an important role in Bhutan’s economy by bridging market gaps. The SOEs, recently have
undergone rigorous review and transformation as a result of overwhelming under performance for
almost over two decades. While some SOEs have shown improvement in profitability and
operational efficiency, overall performance remains a concern due to widespread inefficiencies,
weak competitiveness, and shadowing government agency activities rather than bridging the
market gap as intended.
Additionally, similar to economic wide phenomena of capital-intensive driven growth, SOEs are
also following a similar trend. With the labor’s share of gross profit below 50 percent for all the
SOEs, and the capital productivity declining by more than 3 percent at national level, it highlights
inefficiency and low productivity of SOEs. For SOEs to contribute meaningfully to address
structural issues within the economy, it needs to increase the labor’s share of gross profit to about
70 percent. Further, integrating the market through upstream and downstream linkages of suppliers
along the supply chain and enhancing the value chain should be the priority for SOEs in the 13th
FYP. As a market leader, SOEs need to constantly re-evaluate mandates, foster innovation,
improve efficiency, and strengthen governance to keep Bhutanese economy competitive.
5
Declining capital productivity resulting in stagnant economic efficiency
Since 2008, the long-term growth has fallen to 4 - 5 percent due to declining capital productivity
and stagnating total factor productivity (TFP). While labor productivity increased at an average
rate of 5.0 percent annually between 1990-2022, capital productivity declined by 3.4 percent
annually, reflecting inefficient capital allocation and utilization. Bhutan’s capital-intensive growth
has not translated into productivity gains. Sector-wise, labor productivity has improved except in
tourism, whereby the capital cycle in the hotel and restaurant sector reduced productivity.
Agriculture, the largest employer, remains one of the least productive sectors, growing at only 2.7
percent annually.
One of the most critical challenges facing the Bhutanese economy is the decline in capital
productivity across a majority of the sectors. Capital investment growth of 9.5 percent on average
has outpaced output growth of 6.2 percent, leading to inefficiencies. Bhutan’s capital-output ratio
(COR) increased to 4:1 in 2022, higher than the regional peers, indicating lower returns on
investment. All sectors, including tourism, construction, and manufacturing, experienced decline
in capital productivity, except for finance and insurance, which saw a moderate growth.
Hydropower, while a key economic driver, suffers from delays and cost overruns, and has
limitations on expanding installed generation capacity, resulting in long-run loss in productivity.
Without better resource allocation, capital-intensive driven growth with excessive capital
investment will continue to hinder productivity and economic growth.
TFP, which measures economic efficiency as a result of efficient utilization of labor and capital,
has stagnated, raising concerns regarding Bhutan’s competitiveness in a globally competitive
world. Exacerbating the situation, Bhutan’s productivity gap with India has widened by 2.7
percentage points on average per year since 1990. While manufacturing has seen a modest TFP
growth of 0.2 percent annually between 1990-2022, it has declined at 0.5 percent on average since
2009. With persistent high youth unemployment, re-industrialization through boosting
manufacturing productivity growth can provide the much-needed employment for youths and
economic diversification. To ensure enhancement of productivity and economic growth, Bhutan
must improve capital efficiency, improve industry sector (manufacturing, electricity, and
construction) and enhance overall resource allocation.
Navigating the economic frontier – unlocking growth amid mounting challenges
Bhutan has made significant strides over the past few decades; however, key challenges that have
emerged in the recent years are suppressing the full potential growth. Capital-intensive driven
growth models with over reliance on hydropower and tourism, inefficient and concentrated private
sector and overall decline in manufacturing sector are limiting diversification and economic
growth. This is exacerbated by policy uncertainty, bureaucratic red tape and private sector rent
seeking behavior on public resources. The persistent twin deficits – fiscal and current account –
stem from weak supply-side and inefficient capital utilization. High interest rate spreads and rising
6
NPLs weaken financial stability, while excess money supply in the market in coming years could
trigger inflationary pressure or external imbalance. External imbalance remains a key vulnerability
due to weak and narrow exports and heavy reliance on imports, and SOEs are not able to boost
production as intended during their formation. Inefficient capital allocation has resulted in
stagnated TFP and low labor productivity growth, as a result youth unemployment has been a
persistent issue.
With various challenges comes different opportunities for economic transformation through
strategic initiatives. The visionary GMC initiative has already generated positive expectations
resulting in real-time impact on decline in exodus and civil servants’ attrition rates. It aims to
enhance regional connectivity, trade and investment, requiring energy, digital infrastructure, goods
and services, and a skilled workforce. Additionally, with fiscal reforms targeting to create a
business-friendly fiscal regime, efficient utilization of capital and SOEs reforms – such as business
process re-engineering and kaizen implementation – underway, it is expected to create business
opportunities and an investment environment. Further, deregulation is also expected to grow the
private sector and attract FDI. There is also an opportunity for implementing an industrial
development policy to reverse the trend of premature deindustrialization. Tapping on to these
opportunities has the potential of increasing the labor productivity of a relatively well-educated
workforce and increasing capital utilization and efficacy of capital investment. This should
increase the TFP and as a result shift away from a capital-intensive driven to productivity-led
growth model for long-term economic stability and prosperity.

Chapter 1:
Macroeconomic Outlook
1.1 Introduction
The recent World Economic Outlook (WEO) update released by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) estimates the Global economy to expand by 3.3 percent in both 2025 and 2026, reflecting a
slight improvement from the previous year’s estimate of 3.2 percent. However, the growth
estimates remain below the historical average of 3.7 percent observed from 2000 to 2019,
underscoring persistent structural challenges and policy uncertainties. Advanced economies are
expected to grow at a moderate pace, with the United States (US) leading at 2.7 percent in 2025
due to a resilient labor market, stable monetary policy, and strong investment activity.2 Meanwhile,
the Euro area faces slower expansion at 1.0 percent amid heightened political and economic
uncertainty. Emerging markets and developing economies are expected to sustain stable growth,
with China expanding at 4.6 percent and India at 6.5 percent.3
The World Bank (2025) estimates South Asia to exhibit strong growth of 6.2 percent in 2025 and
2026, largely driven by India’s sustained growth momentum and public infrastructure investments.
The growth estimates for Bangladesh have slowed to 5.0 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023/24 due
to political turbulence, supply constraints, and weakened investor confidence. In contrast, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka saw positive growth driven by improved agriculture and industrial production after
political stabilization. Nepal’s economy grew by 3.9 percent, supported by increased hydropower
production and strong tourism.
Our domestic economy is projected to experience a significant expansion of 8.93 percent in 2025
– nearly double the estimate of 4.97 percent in 2024. This surge in the growth estimates is primarily
attributed to the commissioning of PHP-II and investments in new hydropower projects such as
Khorlochuu and Dorjilung. Further, government intervention through counter-cyclical policy
measures such as the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP) in the agriculture and manufacturing
sectors are expected to enhance domestic production and create employment.4 Additionally, the
measures aimed at increasing tourist arrival through airfare subsidy for international tourists will
have a further spill-over effect on the economic activities of hotel and restaurants, transportation
and communications, and financial services.
However, the domestic growth estimates will depend on the performance of the global and regional
economies. While the growth outlook remains optimistic, there are looming risks emanating from
geopolitical uncertainties, trade policy shifts in major economies, and long-term structural
challenges such as aging population and declining productivity growth. The studies by the IMF
2 According to Goldman Sachs (2024), the Chief Economist writes “The US economy is in a good place”.

concludes that the “Population aging is the most pervasive and dominant global demographic
trend.” (Bloom & Zucker, 2023, P.59). Furthermore, Bhutan remains highly vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change and extreme weather events posing a serious hazard to the growth
outlook.5
1.2 Global Economic Outlook
The global economy is projected to grow by 3.3 percent in 2025 and 2026, 0.1 percentage points
higher than the growth observed in 2024 (IMF, 2025). The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD: 2024) also estimates that the global economy will grow at
the same rate in 2025 and 2026. However, the estimates remain below the historical average of 3.7
percent observed during 2000-2019. Li and Noureldin (2024) assert that without policy
intervention and leveraging emerging technologies, the stronger growth rates of the past are
unlikely to return.
The advanced economies are projected to grow by 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent in 2025 and 2026,
respectively, as compared to a growth of 1.7 percent in 2024 (IMF, 2025). The US is projected to
grow by 2.7 percent in 2025 owing to its robust labor market, less restrictive monetary policy
stance, and accelerating investment, gradually decelerating after reaching the potential level by
2029. However, the recent tariff announcement by the US government will significantly weigh on
its growth outlook and other major economies. It is estimated that the tariff of 25 percent on
imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on imports from China will reduce the long-run
economic output by 0.4 percent before any foreign retaliation (York, 2025). The retaliatory tariff
will reduce the US GDP by 0.05 percent, since the US goods will become less competitive in the
foreign market. The Euro area is expected to experience a gradual growth of 1.0 percent in 2025,
a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points from the October estimates amid heightened political
and policy uncertainty in the areas of energy market, trade and tariff, and ongoing Russia-Ukraine
war (IMF, 2025; WB, 2025).
The growth for emerging markets and developing economies is projected to remain stable with
growth rate hovering around 4.2 percent in 2025 and 2026 (IMF, 2025). The growth estimates for
China remain at 4.6 and 4.5 percent in 2025 and 2026, respectively, reflecting a dissipation of the
trade policy uncertainty and labor supply shortage resulting from increase in the retirement age.
India is projected to grow by 6.5 percent in 2025 and 2026 driven by robust domestic demand due
to increased government spending in infrastructure and rural development.
The near term and medium-term risk to the baseline global outlook are diverse across economies
amid elevated policy uncertainty. The on-going trade-war with retaliation threats by the countries
following President Trump’s announcement will have serious implications on the economic output
and global trade. Additionally, the fiscal and monetary policy choices, intensity of the geopolitical

in the short-term and an additional USD 6,484.8 million for long-term strategy.
10
fragmentation and international spillover, and pursuit of the appropriate structural reforms will
shape the growth outlook (IMF, 2025; WB, 2025).
Figure 1: Global Economic Growth

1.3 Regional Economic Prospect
The Asia and Pacific region is estimated to grow by 4.4 percent in 2025 in anticipation that easing
global and domestic monetary conditions will boost private demand, contributing 60 percent to the
global growth (IMF, 2024). The growth for South Asia is projected to average at 6.2 percent in
2025 and 2026, driven by the resilient activity in India.
The Indian economy recorded a growth of over 7.0 percent for a third consecutive year, driven by
stable consumption and steadily improving investment demand. The World Bank projects the
Indian economy to decelerate to 6.5 percent in FY 2024/25 from 8.2 percent in FY 2023/24,
reflecting slowdown in investment and weak manufacturing growth. India’s domestic projection
shows growth at 6.4 percent in FY 2025/26 supported by agriculture and service sector (GoI,
2025). These trends are expected to continue maintaining India as one of the fastest growing major
economies.
Given political turbulence in mid-2024 that dampened economic activity and worsened investor
confidence, the growth for Bangladesh in FY 2023/24 has slowed to 5.0 percent. Further, the
supply constraints weakened industrial activity and increased price pressure, reducing the
household purchasing power (WB, 2025). The growth in Pakistan and Sri Lanka have turned
positive on account of improved agricultural outputs and industrial production, following reduced
political uncertainty and macroeconomic stabilization. Nepal is estimated to have grown by 3.9
percent in FY 2023/24, on account of higher hydropower production and strong tourism service
activities.
The South Asian Region is projected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2025 and 2026, supported by strong
growth in India. Further, India is poised to become the third largest economy by 2030, after the
11
US and China.6 However, the risk to the growth outlook remains tilted to downside amid
heightened policy uncertainty including trade policy and higher commodity price (WB, 2025).
Additionally, tighter-than-expected monetary policy, climate-related natural disasters, and
weaker-than-expected growth in major economies may impede the regional growth trajectory.
1.4 Domestic Economic Outlook: Supply-side
The economy is projected to grow by 8.93 percent in 2025, a significant increase as compared to
the growth estimate of 4.97 percent in 2024. This increase is mainly on account of the
commissioning of the PHP-II and anticipated commencement of construction of the Khorlochuu
and Dorjilung hydropower projects.7 This growth volatility reflects the sheer size of the economic
vulnerability and susceptibility to the hydropower sector, and thus calls for an economic
diversification to ensure stable and sustained growth. This is further substantiated by historical
evidence, where the commissioning of each hydropower plant has consistently contributed to a
spike in the growth trajectory.
Figure 2: GDP Growth
Similar to the first quarter updates, the growth estimate for 2024 is expected to hover around 4.97
percent. The growth estimate for the construction sector is lowered on account of lower-than-
anticipated spending in the construction of the Khorlochuu, Begana, and Gamri I hydropower
projects. However, the growth for the electricity sector for 2024 is expected to perform better at
3.52 percent from an earlier estimate of 2.85 percent due to higher generation of Nikachhu, which
increased to 529 million Units (MU) from an initial estimate of 474 MU. Additionally, the growth
estimates for real net taxes have been revised from -0.42 percent to 0.41 percent based on the
higher-than-anticipated mobilization of indirect tax revenue.

7 The construction cost of Khorlochhu and Dorjilung are estimated at Nu. 57 billion & Nu. 111 billion respectively.
12
The growth estimate for 2025 stands at 8.93 percent as compared to the previous quarter estimate
of 9.27 percent. This reduction stems from the lower growth estimates in the mining & quarrying
sector and public administration services. However, the downward revision is negated to a certain
extent by the higher growth in the electricity due to the revision in the annual generation capacity
of the PHP-II as we anticipate the full commissioning by June 2025.8
1.4.1 Agriculture Sector
The growth estimates for the agricultural sector stands at 1.52 percent and 1.49 percent for 2024
and 2025, respectively, unchanged from the previous quarter update in absence of reliable high
frequency data. The crop production is estimated to contribute 0.05 percent to the agricultural
sector growth, which is 0.96 percentage points higher than the actual sectoral contribution of -0.90
percent observed in 2023. The livestock production is projected to grow by 2.36 percent in 2025,
contributing 0.90 percent to the agricultural sector growth. The forestry and logging sector is
projected to grow by 3.08 percent, 1.18 percentage points higher than 2024 estimates.
Despite the various interventions initiated by the government, due to the fragmented and scattered
nature of agricultural producers within the economy, the sector has not seen the desired outcome.
Moreover, the impact of government intervention through the ESP is yet to be seen due to minimal
disbursement. The ESP loan disbursement under the Window I and Window II amounts to Nu.
339.690 million and Nu. 236.034 million, respectively. With this, the disbursement rate stands at
10.3 percent and 11.8 percent from the total allocation of Nu. 3,300 million and Nu. 2,000 million
under window I and Window II, respectively.9
1.4.2 Industry Sector
The industry sector is projected to grow by 19.48 percent in 2025 from a growth estimate of 6.24
in 2024, contributing 6.04 percent to the overall growth estimates. This growth is 0.62 percentage
points lower than the first quarter estimates.
The growth estimate for the mining and quarrying sector is revised down to 3.98 percent for 2025
from an earlier estimate of 13.98 percent. The revision is primarily on account of lower-than-
anticipated growth in export of mineral products observed in 2024, which saw only a marginal
increase of 4.70 percent. The manufacturing sector growth is projected to hover around 4.55
percent in 2025 and 2026, an increase of 1.67 percentage points higher as compared to the growth
estimated for 2024.
The electricity sector growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 are revised to 3.52 percent and 20.67
percent, respectively, from the first quarter growth estimates of 2.85 percent and 19.80 percent.
This is on account of higher generation observed for Nikachhu in 2024 and revision in the
generation capacity of the PHP-II, which is estimated to generate 4,575 MU of energy per year
8 The generation capacity of PHP-II has been revised to 4,574 MU from earlier estimate of 4,357 MU
9 Window I: Collateral-free concessional loan at 4% interest rate & Window II: Provides 4 percent interest subsidy
13
from an earlier estimate of 4,357 MU. However, with full generation of PHP-II anticipated only
in June, generation this year is estimated at only 83.03 percent of the total generation capacity.
Additionally, the small hydropower projects such as Yungichhu (32 MW), Burgangchhu (54 MW),
and Suchhu (18 MW) are anticipated to begin commissioning in 2025, adding another 474 MU to
the energy generation in 2025 and 496 MU by 2026.
The construction sector is projected to grow by 10.68 percent and 30.04 percent in 2024 and 2025,
from a previous estimate of 12.05 percent and 29.92 percent, respectively. The downward revision
of growth estimates for 2024 is mainly due to the lower-than-estimated spending in the
hydropower construction such as Khorlochhu, Begana, and Gamri I. On the other hand, the upward
revision of growth in 2025 is on account of higher disbursement estimates for PHP-I and
Khorlochhu, and the anticipated construction of Dorjilung. In the near-term, the construction sector
will be the key driver of the growth. This also means higher imports of the labor inputs and
construction materials, making the growth outlook vulnerable to the external economic
fluctuations.
1.4.3 Service Sector
The service sector is projected to grow by 4.34 percent in 2025 from an estimated growth of 5.38
percent in 2024, contributing 2.35 percent to the overall growth estimate. The performance of the
service sector will be fueled by the growth contribution of the wholesale and retail trade (0.55
percent), transport and storage (1.21 percent), hotel and restaurants (0.86 percent), communication
(0.65 percent), finance and insurance (0.54 percent), real estate and dwellings (0.22 percent), and
education services (0.37 percent). However, the growth in the public administration services is
estimated to decline by 2.62 percent given that the real wage and provident fund contributions
growths are negative. This trend signals a need for reforms to social security and retirement plans
to ensure adequate financial security, one of the key factors driving skilled worker exodus in recent
years.
In the near-term, the performance of the service sector will be contingent upon the recovery
anticipated in the tourism sector (MoF, 2024). In 2024, the sector received 144,973 SDF-paying
tourists, achieving 96.5 percent of the arrival target of 150,000. In 2025, the total tourist arrivals
target of the government stands at 250,000, gradually achieving the pre-pandemic level arrival by
2027. The government has launched an airfare subsidy scheme to enhance the tourist arrival and
length of stay, to expedite the tourism sector recovery. The better performance in the tourism sector
will have a positive spill-over effect on the service-based industries such as hotel and restaurant,
real estate, communication, transport, and financial services.
In the medium-term, the economy’s growth is projected to hover around 6.26 percent, slightly
below India’s growth rate which stands at 6.7 percent. However, the current growth estimates do
not account for the development of the Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC), whose investments is
estimated at 30 times the national GDP, amounting to US$100 billion (Campbell, 2025).
14
1.5 Domestic Economic Outlook: Demand-Side
The aggregate demand growth in 2025 is projected to increase to 8.93 percent as compared to the
growth of 4.97 percent in 2024. The aggregate demand is projected to be fueled by the growth in
public investment due to the increase in the capital expenditure to Nu. 38,334.315 million in FY
2024/25 from Nu. 30,672.055 million in FY 2023/24.10 The recent budget call notification suggests
that the government investment is further estimated to increase to Nu.53,786.420 million,
enhancing the government investment demand by 25.46 percent and 16.12 percent in 2025 and
2026, respectively.11 Similarly, private investment is projected to increase by 12.33 percent in
2025 from 3.35 percent in 2024, largely driven by the higher investment in the hydropower sector
and private construction activities as the housing loan moratorium is lifted.
The government consumption is projected to grow by 3.48 percent in 2025 as compared to an
estimated growth of 4.52 percent in 2024. This is mainly on account of minimal growth in the
primary recurrent expenditure. On the other hand, private consumption will decline by 2.36 percent
in 2025 due to the decline in the real wage growth, despite providing a certain cushion by the
increase in private sector credit and inward household remittances.
Figure 3: GDP by Expenditure
1.6 Output Gap
Although Bhutan has experienced positive economic growth over the past three years, the
country’s actual GDP remains below its potential since the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an
untapped economic potential. The output gap was estimated at approximately 3.0 percent in 2022,
indicating significant underutilization of resources, likely due to lingering effects of the COVID-

19 pandemic, disruptions in key sectors such as industry and tourism. However, as economic
activities gradually recovered and the implementation of the 13th FYP began in July 2023, the gap
narrowed to 0.6 percent in 2023, estimated at Nu. 155,964.142 million. This suggests that Bhutan
is on the path to closing the gap, but still has room for further growth.
Figure 4: Output Gap
The achievement of the potential output will entail providing gainful employment opportunities in
a more productive sector as one-sixth of the youth remain unemployed.12 The skilling programs,
innovation and entrepreneurship, and access to finance has to be strengthened. This will also
address the skills shortages in the labor market as many experienced and skilled professionals
migrate for education and employment opportunities abroad. The increase in government spending
in the 13th FYP and ESP aimed at stimulating aggregate demand and achieving optimal growth,
shall be duly monitored and the efficiency in the use of the capital expenditure utilization has to
be strengthened.13
1.7 External Sector Vulnerabilities
Bhutan as an economy remains highly vulnerable to the external market shocks due to the high
trade and financial exposures stemming from its reliance on the hydropower exports, persistent
trade deficit, and rising external debt. The narrow export base, with limited diversification beyond
hydropower and a few other sectors such as minerals and tourism, makes the economy vulnerable
to external shocks. Another major concern is Bhutan’s high external debt – exchange rate shock –
and commodity market shocks. The main shock in the commodity market stems from fuel price

13 Capital Expenditure utilization as of 31st December stands at 17 percent in FY 2024-25.
16
volatility as it is influenced by geo-politics, trade disputes and economics. Therefore, to assess the
shock of fluctuations of global oil prices, a simulation is carried out to study the impact on the
domestic economic outlook for the period of 2025-2030 using a recursive dynamic Computable
General Equilibrium (CGE) Model.
The CGE model for Bhutan using the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as given in Annexure I,
was developed using the Supply-Use Table (SUT) 2017. The global oil price shock has been
simulated under three scenarios – Scenario I: “10 percent increase,” Scenario II: “20 percent
increase” and Scenario III: “10 percent decrease” to study its implication on the different
macroeconomic aggregates.
i. Fuel Import: If the global oil price rises by 10 percent and 20 percent, Bhutan’s fuel imports are
expected to decline by 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, during the simulation period.
However, a 10 percent decrease in global oil prices would lead to an average annual increase of 6
percent in Bhutan’s fuel imports compared to the baseline level. We observe an asymmetric price
transmission, as consumers have limited ability to reduce fuel consumption due to its necessity in
essential economic activities despite the price fluctuation in absence of domestic supply of fuel.
However, when price decreases, the consumer exhibits greater flexibility in increasing the fuel
consumption, leading to a higher increase.
Figure 5: Impact on Fuel Import
ii. Tax revenue: Due to the decline in fuel imports caused by rising global oil prices, tax revenue
is expected to decrease marginally by 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent under Scenario I and Scenario
II, respectively. However, under Scenario III, tax revenue is projected to increase by 0.3 percent
due to increased fuel imports. This is in tandem with the impact observed in the fuel import.

iii. Government Current Account Balance14: The government’s current account deficit is
expected to average 1.8 percent of GDP during the simulation period. However, a 10 percent and
20 percent increase in global oil prices will reduce imports, leading to lower tax revenue and
widening the current account deficit to 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent of GDP, respectively.
Conversely, higher tax revenue from a decline in oil prices will improve the current account deficit
to 1.4 percent of GDP.
Figure 7: Government Current Account Balance (% of GDP)
iv. Total Output: An increase in fuel prices will push up the input costs for energy-intensive sectors
like transportation and manufacturing. Since these sectors play a crucial role in the broader supply
chain, the higher costs will cascade through the economy, leading to increased cost of production
and delivery for other goods and services. As a result, consumers will face higher prices, reducing
their disposable income and limiting both household consumption and investment. This
inflationary pressure will gradually dampen overall economic activity and output. Conversely, a

18
decrease in fuel prices will lower input costs, making production more affordable and stimulating
greater economic activity, thereby fostering growth across industries.
Figure 8: Total Output
v. Economic Growth: A rise in energy prices will lead to reduced economic activity and
production, resulting in a slowdown in economic growth compared to baseline projections. Under
Scenario I, growth is expected to decline by 0.7 percent, while in Scenario II, the decline could
reach 1.4 percent. This is due to the increased cost burden on businesses and consumers, which
restrains production, reduces disposable income, and dampens investment. Conversely, a decline
in energy prices will ease production costs, boost consumer purchasing power, and encourage
investment, ultimately driving higher economic growth through increased production and
consumption.

1.8 Conclusion
Bhutan’s economy is projected to grow by 8.93 percent in 2025, nearly doubling from the estimate
of 4.97 percent in 2024. This surge is primarily attributed to the commissioning of the PHP-II
hydropower project and increased investments in new hydropower constructions, including
Khorlochhu and Dorjilung. The electricity sector is expected to see substantial growth, with an
upward revision in generation capacity of PHP-II, while the construction sector is expected to
remain a key driver of the economy in the near-term.
Meanwhile, the agricultural sector’s growth remains steady at around 1.5 percent in both years, on
account of low productivity, absence of large-scale commercial farming, and inadequate
technological adoption. The impact of government intervention through ESP is yet to materialize,
given slow disbursements and the production cycle.
The industry sector is expected to expand significantly, reaching 19.48 percent growth in 2025,
though mining and quarrying growth projections have been lowered due to weaker-than-expected
mineral exports performance in 2024. The service sector, while growing, is expected to slow
slightly to 4.34 percent in 2025, with its performance closely tied to the recovery of tourism.
While medium-term growth is projected at 6.3 percent, slightly below India’s 6.7 percent, Bhutan’s
long-term economic outlook could be significantly reshaped by the GMC project, a proposed $100
billion investment – 30 times the country’s GDP – that could transform the national economy over
the years. GMC is being envisioned to create new economic opportunities, enhance regional
connectivity and transport, foster innovation and learning, and serve as a hub of mindful living.
This gives a lot of hope for Bhutanese, living within and abroad, for a wide range of economic
opportunities in future.
However, the baseline growth outlook will be shaped by the performance of other major and
advanced economies. Current estimates show that a global oil price fluctuation alone can have a
significant impact on the growth outlook by impacting the economic activity, highlighting the
economy’s vulnerability to the external economic, financial, and commodity market fluctuations.

Chapter 2:
Fiscal Situation and Outlook
2.1 Introduction
Governments around the world continue to face fiscal challenges, balancing limited revenue
streams against rising spending obligations.15 While many nations have experienced increased
revenue post-pandemic, developing countries still struggle with inadequate fiscal support,
mounting debt burdens, and structural economic constraints.
In recent years, Bhutan has witnessed an improvement in domestic revenue due to increased
economic activities and fiscal reforms. The domestic revenue is projected to see a marginal
increase of 0.95 percent compared to the previous quarter’s estimate, primarily due to higher
collections of indirect taxes and a profit transfer of Nu. 416.860 million from the Mangdechhu
Hydropower Project (MHP). Similarly, external grants are estimated at Nu.18,172.989 million,
reflecting a 11.60 percent increase in the same period based on additional incorporation. However,
the revenue growth remains insufficient to match the pace of rising public expenditure, resulting
in a widening fiscal gap in the absence of new revenue sources.
On the expenditure side, estimates for FY 2024/25 stands at Nu. 91,400.792 million, an increase
by 1.76 percent from the previous quarter, which is attributed to additional incorporation of the
capital expenditure from external financing, including the ESP. Consequently, the revised fiscal
deficit for the FY 2024/25 stands at 4.65 percent of GDP, a slight improvement from previous
quarter’s estimates of 5.34 percent. As a result, in FY 2024/25, total public debt is estimated to
reach Nu. 306,319.776 million, with further increases expected in the medium term to finance
hydropower construction and meet budgetary deficits. The growing public debt necessitates
stronger fiscal discipline, enhanced debt management strategies, and proactive policy measures to
maintain macroeconomic stability. To enhance the analytical capacity for fiscal sustainability, the
central government balance sheet for 2023 has been presented as per the Government Financial
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 standards.
2.2 Fiscal Policy
Bhutan’s fiscal policy aims to ensure sustained economic growth while maintaining a sustainable
fiscal path.16 With the commencement of the 13th FYP, the government has adopted an
expansionary fiscal policy that is countercyclical in nature designed to stimulate economic growth
and close the potential output gap. The approved 13th FYP outlay stands at Nu. 512,000 million,
15As IMF (2024) Fiscal Monitor report states, “Deficits are high, and global public debt is very high and rising, projected to go
above $100 trillion at the end of 2024”
16 Ministry of Finance (2024). National Budget Financial Year 2024-25
21
marking a significant 65.16 percent increase from the approved 12th FYP outlay of Nu. 310,000
million.
In implementing the 13th FYP, the government’s fiscal policy will be anchored on maintaining a
fiscal deficit within 3.0 percent of GDP on average. This approach aligns with the broader fiscal
policy objectives of ensuring sound fiscal discipline and maintaining a sustainable debt level.
Government spending will be focused on strategic investments in infrastructure projects, economic
development, social security, and good governance. Additionally, efforts will be made to enhance
the efficient utilization of existing capital infrastructure, fiscal transparency and improve public
financial management to optimize resource allocation and expenditure efficacy.
2.3 Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF)
In the 13th FYP, the resources have been allocated strategically within the MTFF to maintain the
3 percent fiscal deficit target. Despite the revised total outlay of Nu. 91,400.792 million, given the
upward revision of resources to Nu.77,393.114 million, the overall fiscal balance for FY 2024/25
is projected to improve to a deficit of Nu. 14,007.678 million, accounting for 4.65 percent of GDP,
showing a slight improvement by 0.69 percentage point as compared to the first quarter estimates.
This is mainly driven by upward revision in the domestic revenue, other receipts, and external
grants incorporated during the second quarter update.
In the medium term, the fiscal deficit for FY 2025/26 is projected to deteriorate to 5.85 percent of
GDP before it improves to 2.05 percent of GDP in FY 2026/27. This is mainly due to an increase
in recurrent expenditures including interest payment, without a proportionate increase in the
resources. The primary deficit estimate stands at 2.28 percent and 3.38 percent of GDP in FY
2024/25 and FY 2025/26, respectively. This indicates the rising cost of debt repayment, which is
over 50 percent of the fiscal deficit and represents about 14 percent of the current expenditure in
FY 2024/25. However, with anticipated growth in tax and non-tax revenue, alongside the
mobilization of external grants, the medium-term fiscal outlook including the primary balance is
expected to improve. In addition, greater importance should also be placed on expenditure
rationalization and fiscal adjustments.

While the MTFF helps smoothen the cyclical component between the plan periods, it is essential
to address the short-term cyclical component of fiscal spending within the fiscal year. The
quarterly fiscal framework helps track the government activities within the FY. Gradually, it
should help smoothen the spending within the FY.

In percent of GDP (0.75) 3.58 (2.23) (6.29) (4.18) (2.28)
In the current quarter, the fiscal deficit deteriorated to Nu. 2,830.149 million, as opposed to a fiscal
surplus of Nu. 1,137.040 million in first quarter of FY 2024/25. The fiscal deficit is about 3.76
percent of GDP, of which the primary deficit is about 2.23 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit in
the second quarter of FY 2024/25 is at a similar level to the same quarter of FY 2023/24, indicating
that this is a trend. In the next two quarters, the fiscal deficits are expected to further deteriorate.
The highest deficit of Nu. 6,987.031 million is projected to be in the third quarter, followed by a
deficit of Nu. 5,327.537 million in the fourth quarter. The reason for lower fiscal deficit in the
fourth quarter despite the higher expenditure is because of higher revenue inflows in the fourth
quarter. This highlights the government’s dependency on periodical/seasonal income tax to finance
its activities. While it is not a major issue, it is important for the government to spread its income
inflows evenly among the quarters. Therefore, a strategic shift of revenue reliance from income
tax to goods and services tax would help smoothen fiscal path and cash management for the
government.
Similarly, the quarterly primary balance is expected to be in deficits indicating increasing reliance
on debt financing to balance its budget, increasing servicing cost. The current expenditure
utilization in the second quarter is Nu. 10,749.145 million showing a modest increase from Nu.
10,110.862 million in the first quarter. On the other hand, capital spending grew by 48.89 percent
compared to the previous quarter, reflecting a significant progress. The spending projections in the
subsequent quarters reveal that current expenditure growth is linear while the capital spending
24
spikes a lot as we move towards the end of the FY. This erratic capital expenditure pattern could
be attributed to many factors including the improper planning and programs execution. Moreover,
to address the structural challenges in the economy, mainly declining capital productivity, the
capital expenditure should be focused and existing capital utilization should be emphasized.
2.5 Fiscal Performance
2.5.1 Revenue
In the 13th FYP, one of the fiscal policy targets is to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio from the current
13 percent to 15 percent through various tax reforms aimed at expanding the tax base and adopting
non-distortionary tax policies. For FY 2024/25, the tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach 13.40
percent, slightly exceeding the 13.00 percent target outlined in the Budget Report 2024/2518. As
illustrated in Figure 10, revenue has shown a consistent upward trend over the years, with
significant growth of 24.09 percent in FY 2017/18 and 24.82 percent in FY 2023/24. These surges
were primarily driven by substantial improvements in tax performance during those periods.
However, revenue growth for the current FY 2024/25 is expected to be more modest at 2.12
percent. Looking ahead, revenue is estimated to grow significantly by 13.88 percent in FY
2025/26, largely due to the anticipated profit transfer from the commissioning of PHP-II and
implementation of GST.
Figure 10: Revenue Growth Trend
The GST system is an efficient taxation system eliminating cascading effects of taxes and removes
the distortionary effect through its broad-based application. As a business-friendly taxation system,
introduction of GST is expected to enhance tax compliance, broaden tax base, and increase revenue
18 Ministry of Finance (2024). National Budget Financial Year 2024-25
25
in the long-run, thereby contributing to a more sustainable increase in revenue collection.
However, for the GST implementation to meet its expectations, it is important that the exemption
list and EET be revised.

The latest update on the revenue performance and projections of this FY is shown in Table 4. In
the second quarter, the domestic revenue estimate for FY 2024/25 has been revised upward to Nu.
57,202.764 million from Nu. 55,486.252 million in the first quarter estimate. This increase is
mainly on account of profit transfer of Nu. 416.860 million from MHP and upward revision in the
indirect taxes based on actual collection realised as of 31st December 2024.
As of 31st December 2024, the cumulative domestic revenue collection stood at Nu. 22,176.041
million, which is 38.77 percent of the revised estimate. While the revenue collection in the first
quarter was Nu. 12,203.579 million, the second quarter collection dropped to Nu. 9,972.462
million. This decrease could be attributed to the seasonality of the tax filling and one-time profit
transfer of Nu. 2,181.047 million received from RMA in the first quarter. However, the revenue
realized in this quarter has increased by 5 percent as compared to the same quarter in the FY
2023/24, primarily due to higher tax collection.
Overall, the majority of the revenue for FY 2024/25 is still expected to come from income tax
contributing about 30.22 percent to the total revenue. This is closely followed by revenue from
dividends and profit transfers, which is expected to contribute about 28.96 percent of the total
revenue, followed by taxes on goods and services, and royalties. In total, almost about 40 percent
of the entire revenue directly comes from the public sector financial and non-financial
corporations.
2.5.2 Grants
Bhutan still receives substantial foreign aid in the form of grants amounting to about 23.48 percent
of total resources. Of the various multilateral and bilateral development partners, India remains the
major development partner with grants amounting 16.66 percent of total resource and over 70.95
percent of the total external grant in FY 2024/25. Since the domestic revenue is only sufficient to
cover the cost of recurrent expenses and partially the capital expenditure, the infrastructural
development projects are heavily dependent on external grants and borrowing.
The external grant estimate for FY 2024/25 has been revised to Nu.18,172.989 million during the
second quarter, an upward revision from Nu.16,283.770 million in the previous quarter. This
revision is mainly on account of external financing incorporations of the budgetary agencies
relating to the project tied-assistance from development partners and the ESP amounting to Nu.
1,200 million.
As of 31st December 2024, the cumulative external grant receipts amounted to Nu. 2,914.639
million representing 16.04 percent of the total anticipated grant inflows for the fiscal year. The
grant receipts from the GoI stands at 6.83 percent19 of the revised estimate while the receipt from
other development partners stands at 38.53 percent.
19 Grants received from India excludes an ESP grant of Nu. 2,500 million received in current FY.

2.5.3 Expenditure
In line with the expansionary fiscal policy adopted by the government, the government expenditure
is expected to increase by 30.16 percent in the current FY. This pattern is also consistent with the
previous trends as a consequence of the five-year planning cycle. As shown in Figure 11,
government expenditure surged by 36.23 percent in FY 2019/20, the second year of the 12th FYP.
A similar spike is observed in FY 2024/25, the first year of the 13th FYP, and in the subsequent
FY 2025/26, the expenditure increases by 17.33 percent.

20 The grants receipts include only the budgetary grants excluding ESP.

Conversely, government spending tends to decline during the transition periods between FYPs.
For instance, in FY 2018/19, expenditure growth dropped significantly by 21.98 percent as a result
of the five-year planning cycle. Similarly, during the transition between the 12th and 13th FYPs,
i.e. FY 2023/24, the expenditure growth was modest at 1.44 percent. It is therefore important that
in the 13th FYP, an expenditure smoothing strategy should be adopted.
The latest update on the projected government spending for FY 2024/25 is provided in Table 6.
The total projected outlay for the FY 2024/25 is revised to Nu. 91,400.792 million from the first
quarter revised estimate of Nu. 89,818.107 million. This upward revision is mainly due to
additional budget incorporation from the agencies during the quarter. The revised estimate reflects
a 30.16 percent increase from FY 2023/24. Of this total, Nu. 50,854.770 million (55.64 percent of
the revised estimate) is allocated for recurrent expenditure, while Nu. 40,546.022 million (44.36
percent of the revised estimate) is earmarked for capital expenditure.

At the end of the second quarter of FY 2024/25, total expenditure utilization reached Nu.
27,649.593 million, accounting for 30.25 percent of the revised estimate. This is slightly higher in
absolute terms compared to Nu. 27,200.153 million recorded in the same quarter of the previous
year. However, last year’s expenditure utilization rate was higher at 35.61 percent of the revised
estimate, indicating a slower pace this year. This lag in government spending raises concerns about
the potential budget underutilization and expenditure planning undertaken by the agencies, as a
result the spending may not have the desired impact on the economy. Ideally, by the midpoint of
the FY, around 50 percent of the budget should have been utilized to ensure steady progress in
planned activities. The concern is more pronounced in capital expenditure, where only 16.75
29
percent of the budget has been utilized, 7.78 percentage points lower than the same period last
year. Given that capital investments are significant in nature and critical for infrastructure
development, such improper planning could result in the mismanagement of the cashflow for the
government and inferior procurement resulting in low quality infrastructure. The expenditure
utilization is expected to gain momentum in the coming quarters as project implementation
advances.
This cyclical nature of the government spending that follows the FYP needs strategic investment
plans to minimize the distortion to the economy at the end and beginning of the plan period.
Expansionary spending which helps stimulate growth during the plan period, is reversed during
the down-turn in the economy at the beginning and the end of the FYP. As a small landlocked
country with a nascent private sector, government investment to boost the economy is important.
However, maintaining fiscal sustainability also remains crucial as the level of spending continues
to grow. A well-calibrated approach of balancing economic stimulus with prudent fiscal
management will be essential for ensuring long-term macroeconomic stability and sustainable
development.
2.5.4 Public Debt
The total estimated public debt by the end of FY 2024/25 is projected at Nu. 306,319.776 million,
reflecting a 4.0 percent decrease from the first quarter estimate of Nu. 319,066.504 million,
accounting for 101.79 percent of GDP. The anticipated reduction in total public debt can be
attributed primarily to a downward revision of external loan disbursement of small hydropower
projects and the liquidation of the Basochhu hydropower project (Lower Stage). Additionally,
there has been a shift in the borrowing approach for program loans from the first quarter for the
program borrowing, reflecting the prudent public finance management stance taken by the
government. Furthermore, 50 percent of the loans from the International Development Association
is expected to be in the form of grants, which facilitate public debt management in the medium
term. Consequently, in comparison to the first quarter projections, the public debt as a percentage
of GDP is expected to decrease over the medium term.
Of the total public debt, approximately 90.05 percent of the total public debt by the end of FY
2024-25 will consist of external debt, while domestic debt is projected to account for 9.95 percent.
For FY 2025/26, public debt is expected to rise by Nu. 90,246.063 million, driven primarily by the
capitalization of the interest during construction for the PHP-II coupled with the increasing
financing needs associated with the new hydropower projects and budgetary expenditures. In the
medium term, both external and domestic debt levels are anticipated to increase due to additional
disbursements related to hydropower initiatives and budgetary borrowings aimed at addressing the
financing gap. This trend underscores the necessity for comprehensive financial planning to ensure
sustainable debt management as financing requirements evolve.

The central government debt is projected to decline to Nu. 112,124.089 million (37.26 percent of
GDP) for FY 2024/25, down from the first quarter estimate of Nu. 121,441.198 million. This
decrease is primarily due to an enhancement in overall resources, which has resulted in a
diminishing need for domestic borrowings. As a result, the central government debt as a percent
of GDP is anticipated to improve relative to the projections made in the first quarter, remaining
well within the threshold prescribed by the Public Debt Management Policy.

2.6 Efficacy of Fiscal Spending
2.6.1 Fiscal Multiplier
The fiscal multiplier measures the impact of a change in the government spending or taxation on
a country’s overall economic output. It provides us with an indication of how economic output
responds to the government fiscal policy. In simpler terms, it quantifies how much economic
activity is generated by one unit of ngultrum spent by the government through fiscal policies. The
fiscal multiplier based on the fiscal data from the FY 2009/10 to FY 2023/24 is presented in Table
8.
Table 8: Fiscal Multiplier
Particulars Fiscal Multiplier
Recurrent Expenditure 1.1
Capital Expenditure 0.1
Total Expenditure 0.8
The fiscal multiplier for the government spending is positive, indicating the positive impact of the
government spending on the economic output. It implies that for every unit of government
spending, the gross domestic output will increase by 0.8 units. However, since the multiplier is
less than 1 unit, it indicates that government spending has a weaker effect, each ngultrum
generating less than a ngultrum of output. As opposed to the rational expectation, the spending
multiplier is higher for recurrent than capital expenditure. This implies inefficiencies in the capital
spending, a finding further corroborated by the declining capital productivity discussed in Chapter
8.
2.6.2 Counter-cyclical Fiscal Policy (Fiscal Stance and Impulse)
The government uses counter-cyclical fiscal policy to correct economic fluctuations such as
recession and boom. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, counter-cyclical fiscal
measures such as deferral and waiver of BIT, CIT, rental, electricity, and demand charges were
implemented. Additionally, quasi-fiscal operations in the form of direct income support and loan
interest relief to the household were granted through Druk Gyalpo Relief Kidu.
In the 13th FYP, an ESP amounting to Nu. 15 billion will be implemented over the period of two
years. This, in addition to the significant increase in the plan outlay indicates expansionary fiscal
stance of the government. Table 9 suggests that over the next three FYs, an expansionary fiscal
plan is possible. The positive fiscal impulse for the FY 2024/25 and FY 2025/26 indicates that
government fiscal spending is expansionary compared to preceding years. However, the rate of
expansion in FY 2026/27 is lower than that of FY 2025/26.

This balance sheet represents the stock of non-financial assets, financial assets, and liabilities of
the budgetary central government of Bhutan. It is important to note that the closing balance sheet
of one FY serves as the opening balance sheet for the next. This continuity allows us to link one
year’s balance sheet to the next, creating a series of integrated balance sheets that align with the
transactions and economic flows recorded each year. It is important to note that the figures
presented here might be different from what is presented in traditional fiscal presentations because
of differences in classification.
2.7 Budgetary Central Government Balance Sheet21
The Ministry of Finance has been developing the use of Government Finance Statistics to
strengthen fiscal analysis in recent years. This effort aligns with the IMF’s phased migration
strategy to implement the GFSM 2014 as the standard for fiscal data. The migration strategy
includes incorporating key elements of GFSM 2014 presentation in staff reports and continuing
technical assistance to develop Bhutan’s capacity to produce comprehensive GFS-compliant
data.22 These include development of a preliminary GFS series (2016-2023) for the budgetary
central government and identifying data gaps, with a particular focus on reporting balance sheet
data and expanding coverage to the broader public sector.
The current traditional fiscal reports include some balance sheet data but do not link stocks and
flows. Balance sheet data developed until now indicate the usefulness of the GFS framework as
an analytical tool for fiscal sustainability. Where select balance sheet data have been included, the
focus has primarily been on presenting the concept of gross debt, with limited analysis or
discussion of alternative debt measures. A main reason for not including a more comprehensive
set of balance sheet data – particularly regarding financial assets – is that the traditional fiscal
reporting is not able to produce these data on a regular basis due to various factors.
GFS also allows expansion of institutional coverage of the fiscal data beyond the central
government to include the general government and broader public sector, such as sub-national
government, extrabudgetary funds, and public enterprises, aligning with macroeconomic statistics.
Fiscal surveillance should move beyond cash-flow reporting and a narrow debt definition to a
21 Mr. Gary Jones, GFS expert with IMF, has been supporting the development of the government balance sheet since 2017 and
the results discussed herewith is attributed to his continued support.

comprehensive framework linking economic transactions, deficit, assets, liabilities, and fiscal
risks. The integrated balance sheet analysis, cross-sector linkages and spillovers into policy
formulation are crucial for long-term fiscal sustainability as Bhutan opens up to the rest of the
world. As key sources and users of funding, as well as holders of non-financial assets, it is essential
to enhance the understanding of wealth and financial markets. The development of a balance sheet
matrix for Bhutan showing asset and liability positions in and between key sectors can generate
additional indicators for economic analysis. The following section presents the balance sheet of
the government. While this is the first time such a presentation has been made, some data gaps,
such as information on specific categories of assets and liabilities, have been identified and will
be addressed on a continuous basis.
2.7.1 Government Balance Sheet
As illustrated in Table 10, the integrated balance sheet serves as a valuable tool for fiscal policy
analysis and decision making. For FY 2022/23, the closing net financial worth stood at Nu.
12,160.159 million, reflecting a decline of Nu. 21,347.513 million from the opening net financial
worth of Nu. 33,507.672 million. This reduction is attributed to transactions and other economic
flows occurring throughout the FY.
Despite this decline, the positive net financial worth of Nu. 12,160.159 million indicates that
financial assets exceed liabilities, representing 5.10 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2022/23.
While this is a favorable position, it underscores the need for prudent and sustainable fiscal policies
to prevent further deterioration of financial health. Maintaining a strong net financial worth
requires a balanced approach to revenue generation, expenditure management, and debt
sustainability to ensure long-term fiscal stability.
If the net financial worth continues to deteriorate, it is concerning as it suggests steady increase in
liabilities outpaces the net accumulation of financial assets. This trend can indicate fiscal
imbalances and potential financial instability. However, if the increase in liabilities is directed
toward investments in productive non-financial assets, such as infrastructure, education, or
technology, that yield reasonable returns and contribute to economic growth, the decline in net
financial worth may be sustainable. These investments can enhance productivity, generate higher
revenue over time, and ultimately offset the debt burden, ensuring long-term fiscal stability.
Thus, while a deteriorating net financial worth is a cause of concern, its impact depends on the
utilization of borrowed funds. Prudent debt management and strategic investments are key to
ensuring that liabilities translate into sustainable economic gains rather than financial distress.

2.8 Conclusion
The fiscal policy under the 13th FYP reflects a decisive adoption of expansionary fiscal policy
aimed at stimulating economic growth and addressing the structural challenges plaguing
Bhutanese economy. The substantial increase in fiscal outlay underscores the government’s
commitment to the achievement of the strategic goal of attaining a high-income country by 2034.
While the planned fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP is in line with the 13th FYP deficit target,
short-term fiscal pressure remains, necessitating prudent management of expenditure and debt.
Ensuring fiscal discipline while fostering economic transformation and growth requires efficient
and effective expenditure policy and tax policies that not only mobilize resources but are business
friendly.
Despite an upward trajectory in revenue performance, the reliance on tax revenue remains volatile
due to seasonal fluctuations. The planned implementation of GST is a crucial step towards
broadening the tax base, enhancing government cash flow and avoiding cascading effect of taxes
that is witnessed under the current sales tax regime. However, the current GST law to be effective
will require revision of the EET and exemptions. Additionally, successful execution will require
robust administrative capacity and public awareness. With the implementation of GST, there is no
longer a need for providing separate fiscal incentives as the GST system removes the cascading
effect. Meanwhile, external grants continue to be a significant resource, with India as the largest
contributor.
On the expenditure side, expenditure management poses other challenges, with recurrent spending
projected to rise, driven by interest payment and administration cost, and inefficient capital
utilization. While capital expenditure growth aligns with development priorities, execution
efficiency remains a concern mainly with improper planning and inefficient post evaluation of
infrastructure projects resulting in decline in capital productivity in the economy. Further, the
historical pattern indicates a cyclical spending surge towards the middle of plan, while spending
slows towards the beginning and end of the FYP cycle, underscoring the need for smoothening the
expenditure and adopting counter-cyclical approach to public expenditure. Within the plan period
and especially during the fiscal year, enhancing capital utilization, eliminating last-minute
procurement, and prioritizing high-impact projects will be critical to maximizing fiscal policy
effectiveness.
Looking ahead, Bhutan’s fiscal trajectory will depend on its ability to sustain economic momentum
and address the structural challenges within the economy while maintaining fiscal prudence.
Strengthening public financial management and improving expenditure efficiency to eliminate
sunk cost will be key to ensuring fiscal policy effectiveness. A well-coordinated fiscal strategy
targeting spending efficiency supported by other initiatives such as deregulating domestic
industries and developing industry development strategy will be crucial in achieving the country’s
vision of a high-income country.

Chapter 3:
Monetary and Financial Market Situation and Outlook
3.1 Introduction
The uncertainties surrounding the global geopolitical situation, compounded by the potential trade
war, poses significant risks to the macroeconomic stability of a small economy like Bhutan. While
the interest rate in advanced economies is expected to decline to 4.20 percent, the report also states
that the progress of inflation reduction is stalling (IMF, 2024). This poses a risk of further
tightening of monetary policies to bring down the sticky inflation in advanced economies resulting
in capital flights from developing economies and tightening of domestic monetary policy
irrespective of the economic outlook. This will be further exacerbated by the increased tariff by
advanced economies, which can be seen in the fall of manufacturing outputs in emerging markets
led by China.
A stable and well-performing monetary and financial sector is pivotal in maintaining
macroeconomic stability and supporting economic growth. These include inflation, money supply,
liquidity, credit growth, and financial market performance, all of which influence broader
economic conditions. In the case of Bhutan, with a pegged exchange rate regime and strong capital
control, the ability of the monetary policy to influence the market is limited. Therefore, a
significant portion of the RMA’s effort is focused on maintaining the exchange rate regime through
effective reserves management.
Post-pandemic, due to decline in foreign reserves, significant effort was directed towards
management of the reserves. As a result, moratoriums were imposed on vehicle imports and
housing credit. Additionally, with the slow recovery of the post-pandemic economy, the loan
deferment facility continued till 30th June 2024, which was further extended to 30th June 2025.23
While the financial sector is slowly recovering, continued deferment could impact the financial
institutions. Moreover, such measures used during exceptional economic crises should not be
continued for a longer time as it is subject to moral hazard and rent-seeking behavior.
The 13th FYP period is characterized by significant government-led investment through budgetary
spending and the ESP, aimed to revitalize economic growth and restore Bhutan’s growth trajectory
to its long-term growth potential. Overall, huge injections of money in the economy to increase
the aggregate demand with limited supply will naturally result in either increase in prices or
reduction in reserves as the demand will be met through increased imports. Therefore, it is essential
to have proper monetary policy tools to address issues such as an increase in price, excess liquidity
23 As of December 2024, a total of 5,083 loans have been granted deferment (BDBL=3,849; BOBL=225; BNBL=322; T-
Bank=34; DPNB=173; RICBL=378; BIL=99; NPPF=3)
37
and depletion of reserves, so that the application of extreme counter-productive administrative
measures such as a moratorium can be prevented.
3.2 Monetary Policy Operation
The RMA Act of 2010 mandates that its primary objective is to formulate and implement monetary
policy to achieve and maintain price stability. In pursuit of this objective, the RMA employs a one-
to-one pegged exchange rate with the INR as a monetary policy tool. To support the pegged
exchange rate regime, it focuses on the prudent management of external reserves.
Given the pegged regime and significant dependency on imports, coupled with weak monetary
policy transmission mechanism, the adoption of “inflation targeting” to manage price and
economic stability is ineffective. Therefore, RMA uses Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) as a monetary
policy tool to maintain price stability in the economy by managing liquidity and money supply.
The Monetary Policy Statement 2024 reaffirms its commitment to an accommodative monetary
policy stance, relying on reserve requirements as the primary tool for regulating credit growth and
money supply.
3.3 Price and Inflation
In December 2024, the general inflation increased to 2.02 percent from 1.87 percent in November
2024, bringing the national average inflation for January to December 2024 to 2.83 percent.24 The
increase in the inflation is due to rise in prices in the food and non-alcoholic beverages, offset by
declining prices in non-food items. The divergent trends in price movements, with food prices
rising and non-food items experiencing deflation, present significant implications for Bhutan’s
economy such as the policy dilemma in terms of responding to the mixed inflationary pressures.
Moreover, in the long-run, rising food prices might require fiscal responses from the government
through targeted fiscal measures to provide social safety nets for vulnerable groups. Figure 13
shows the year-on-year monthly inflation trend, however, it is to be noted the figures are likely to
change when the rebasing of backward series becomes available.
24 The CPI was rebased in May 2024 and NSB is yet to publish the backward series. Therefore, average inflation of 2.83 is not
the actual inflation but rather statistical average.
38
Figure 13: Year-on-Year Monthly Inflation Rates
Historically, Bhutan’s economy has been closely linked to India due to geo-political, cultural and
economic ties. Bhutan’s currency peg to the INR constrains the effectiveness of monetary policy
in managing inflationary pressures and reserves, thereby relying on fiscal policy and macro-
prudential regulations. These factors have resulted in Bhutanese economy being heavily influenced
by the Indian economy. As a result, inflation that is being experienced in Bhutan is mostly due to
cost-push inflation associated with the Indian economy.
Figure 14: Annual inflation rates of India and Bhutan (2015-2024)
The parallel movements in inflation rates between Bhutan and India highlight their significant
economic relationship, with both countries experiencing similar shock patterns, particularly during
the 2020-2021 period when both countries saw notable inflation spikes. This is further
substantiated by a strong positive correlation of 0.68, indicating a close price association and
movements between the two countries. The results suggest that a 1 unit increase in India's inflation
39
is associated with a 0.60 unit increase in Bhutan’s inflation. However, Bhutan’s inflation displays
greater volatility and fluctuations compared to India’s relatively stable trajectory.
3.4 Money Supply
The money supply (M2) is projected to reach Nu. 252,522.750 million in FY 2024/25, with further
expansion to Nu. 283,609.190 million in FY 2025/26, reflecting a growth rate of 12.31 percent.
These projections indicate an upward revision compared to the previous quarter’s estimates for
both FY 2024/25 and FY 2025/26. This is primarily attributed to sustained growth in key
components, including savings, time and foreign deposits.

Last update Current update
Figure 15: Money supply (M2)
The growth of the M2 indicates increased injection of money in the economy and liquidity in the
financial system. Increased M2 without subsequent increase in the domestic production could
potentially result in inflation or depletion of reserves, as observed post-pandemic. The impact of
monetary expansion depends on how private sector credit is distributed across the sectors. When
credit is directed toward productive sectors, it promotes sustainable economic growth. Conversely,
credit channeled into unproductive sectors may exacerbate inflationary pressures and external
imbalances, potentially causing macroeconomic volatility.
In view of money supply growth, the money multiplier has demonstrated an upward trajectory,
increasing from 4.70 in FY 2023/24 to 5.12 in FY 2024/25. This indicates that for every Ngultrum
introduced into the banking system, the money supply in the economy increases by 5.12 times, as
a result of the fractional reserve banking system. While this trend supports economic growth, it
also poses a risk of excess liquidity, and thus inflationary pressures if monetary expansion outpaces
real sector productivity. Looking ahead, the money multiplier is projected to rise further to 5.32 in
FY 2025/26, underscoring the need for prudent liquidity management to maintain macroeconomic
stability.

3.5 Credit Situation
3.5.1 Sectoral Credit
The total outstanding credit is projected to reach Nu. 236,409.152 million in FY 2024/25, with a
further increase of 9.20 percent in FY 2025/26. This growth is primarily driven by credit expansion
in housing, tourism and hospitality, manufacturing, and trade and commerce.
Among these, housing holds the largest share of the credit portfolio, with Nu. 77,203.477 million
– 32.66 percent of total credit– as shown in Figure 16. This is followed by hotel and tourism with
Nu. 29,220.697 million, reflecting substantial investment in tourism infrastructure development
and hospitality sector. Manufacturing ranks third, with a credit exposure of Nu. 27,787.868
million, underscoring its importance in the overall credit landscape. The credit allocation pattern
reveals a significant concentration in the real estate market such as housing and tourism,
highlighting potential sectoral concentration risks. With capital cycle phenomena overshadowing
tourism and housing being a non-tradable sector, concentration of credit allocation into these
sectors might increase financial sector risks significantly.
Figure 16: Sectoral Credit and Cumulative Share (%)
Despite being a vital sector that supports the majority of the population, agriculture continues to
receive limited credit, reflecting lower returns of rural enterprises. Acknowledging the financial
constraints faced by agriculture producers, various policies such as priority sector lending scheme,
national credit guarantee and others were instituted. However, the sector records a relatively high
level of NPLs, highlighting the low productivity of the agriculture sector and risks associated with
agricultural lending. Lack of proper supply and value chain, logistic and market access are some
of the major factors contributing to lower agricultural sector productivity. Meanwhile, the service
sector receives moderate credit support, suggesting scope for optimizing credit distribution. The
41
concentration of loans in specific sectors requires close monitoring from a financial stability
perspective, as high exposure to a few sectors increases systemic risks, especially during sector-
specific downturns.
3.5.2 Non-Performing Loans
The data reveals concerning levels of NPLs across various sectors. As of November 2024, housing
shows the highest NPL at Nu. 1,426.914 million, followed closely by trade and commerce at Nu.
1,372.549 million, and transport at Nu. 890.513 million. The concentration of NPLs in these
sectors indicates potential for systemic vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
Figure 17: Sectoral NPL and Ratio against NPL Ratio Threshold
Further, the NPL ratio threshold of 5.00 percent has been breached in 4 of the 15 loan categories,
as shown in Figure 17.25 Most notably, transport exhibits the highest NPL ratio at 13.11 percent,
followed by agriculture and livestock at 11.01 percent. Personal and manufacturing also show
concerning levels breaching the threshold. These elevated ratios point to substantial risk factors
within the banking sector’s credit portfolio. High NPL in housing, combined with its dominant
share of total credit, presents a significant risk to the overall banking sector’s asset quality.
Additionally, the elevated NPL ratios in transport and agriculture sectors, despite their relatively
smaller credit shares, suggest underlying structural issues that require attention. The persistent
breach of the 5 percent NPL ratio threshold across multiple sectors indicates broader systemic
credit quality concerns that necessitate comprehensive response strategies.

3.6 Liquidity and Policy Rates
3.6.1 Liquidity
The CRR, a key tool for managing liquidity in the market, is set at 8.00 percent and expected to
remain unchanged for FY 2024/25 and FY 2025/26. Current estimates for liquidity after meeting
the CRR is projected at Nu. 14,107.633 million. However, the liquidity outlook for the subsequent
periods are expected to follow a downward trajectory, primarily driven by the increase in import
due to anticipated disbursement of the ESP loans and increased investment activities across various
sectors.
Figure 18: Liquidity Position
The reintroduction of the sweeping arrangement in the coming year, which was temporarily
suspended in June 2023, is expected to manage excess liquidity in the banking sector. As a result
of these factors, the projected liquidity positions after accounting for CRR for both FY 2024/25
and FY 2025/26 are anticipated to be notably lower than the projections made during the previous
quarter. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that excess liquidity followed by administrative
measures resulting in tighter liquidity conditions has been the trend in the past two decades.
Therefore, it is critical to institute diverse tools to address financial market concerns rather than
relying on administrative measures, which is counterproductive to economic growth.
3.6.2 Policy Rates
The RMA’s establishment of a 6.50 percent policy rate is expected to be a crucial monetary policy
stance.26 The implementation of this policy rate is expected to create a foundation for developing
26 Royal Monetary Authority. (2024). Annual Report 2024 (p. 92).
43
a more market-based monetary policy operational framework. Through instruments like Open
Market Operations (OMO), RMA can enhance its capacity to manage systemic liquidity more
effectively. This development is particularly crucial for fostering a more dynamic and better
financial market infrastructure in Bhutan. However, it is important to note that the Minimum
Lending Rate (MLR) was established with similar objectives, yet the monetary policy transmission
effectiveness was limited. Therefore, due to the pegged-exchange rate regime, it is important to
deploy various measures to influence the financial market.
3.7 Interest Rates
3.7.1 Lending Rates
The lending rates as of 2024 show significant variation across different sectors and financial
institutions (FI). Personal loans have the highest lending rates, reaching up to 14.00 percent with
Bhutan Insurance Limited (BIL), while government employee loans show relatively lower rates at
8.50 percent, reflecting their lower risk profile. Rates for general trade range from 11.16 to 13.00
percent, indicating the sector’s moderate risk assessment by FIs. Among the FIs, BOBL offers
competitive rates, especially in business and trade financing, while BIL tends to maintain the
highest rates, reflecting its distinct risk assessment approach, as shown in Figure 19. Overall, the
lending rate spread between highest and the lowest is 6.00 percent, reflecting different risk appetite
by the FIs’ on different lending products.
Figure 19: Lending Rates in Percent27
The lending rate environment is expected to remain relatively stable in the short term, though
competitive pressures may drive selective rate adjustments in specific sectors. As a result of the
sticky yet high lending rate, the government has offered concessional credit in various forms for
27 The rates presented are the averages of the rates segmented by maturity.
44
over a decade, more recently, the concessional credit line through ESP. However, such continued
interventions are not beneficial to the FIs as well as the overall economy. There is potential for
more sophisticated pricing models that FIs can adopt, that better reflect borrower credit worthiness
and sector-specific risks. Competition among the FIs may also catalyze innovation in lending
products and pricing structures, potentially leading to more differentiated offerings for various
customer segments. This evolution in lending rates should contribute to a more efficient and
competitive financial sector while maintaining prudent risk management practices.
3.7.2 Deposit Rates
Among the five deposit taking banks, BDBL offers the highest interest rate at 5.60 percent, while
BOBL offers the lowest at 4.50 percent for saving deposits. For recurring deposits, BNBL offers
the highest interest rate at 7.72 percent, while BOBL has the lowest rate at 6.70 percent. In fixed
deposits, BDBL offers the highest interest rate at 7.36 percent, while BOBL offers the lowest at
6.23 percent, as shown in Figure 20.
Figure 20: Deposit Rates
The current interest rate structure indicates healthy competition among banks, with some
institutions offering higher rates to attract long-term deposits. This competitive environment is
likely to continue, with banks adjusting rates in response to economic conditions and market
dynamics. Higher deposit rates for longer durations, particularly in recurring and fixed deposits,
indicate that banks are strategically focusing such instruments as their source of stable capital and
to reduce asset-liability maturity mismatch. However, it is important to note that the interest rate
spread between lending and borrowing is about 6.28 percent, which is relatively high compared to
other economies.28 While policy decisions need to be based on weighted interest rate spread, a
simple interest rate spread also highlights the inefficiency and risk-adverse nature of FIs.
28 Business Standard (2024). The interest rate spread hit a low of 2.25 percent for Public Sector Banks of India.
45
3.8 Capital Market
The capital market is essential for economic growth, providing alternative sources of long-term
funding for businesses, governments and individuals. A well-functioning capital market
strengthens the financial system, fosters growth and boosts investor confidence. With a market
capitalization of Nu. 59,077.402 million, it represents approximately 21.00 percent of the GDP.
The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan plays a modest but growing role in the financial
system.29 Currently, there are 18 listed companies with 9 security brokerage firms.
The market structure is heavily dominated by the FIs, which accounts for 73.56 percent of total
market capitalization. This indicates a strong concentration in financial services, making the
market highly reliant on the stability of the banking and insurance industries. This is followed by
the manufacturing sector accounting for 21.40 percent. The tourism and services sector holds the
smallest share at 5.04 percent despite its significant contribution to the economy, suggesting
underrepresentation in the capital market.
Figure 21: Market Capitalization by Sector
Bhutan’s capital market must evolve beyond its current FIs dominance by fostering greater sectoral
diversification. Encouraging manufacturing, tourism, and technology-driven industries to
participate in the market will enhance economic resilience. Additionally, supporting SMEs through
incentives to access equity financing can strengthen market depth. Investments in tourism and
services, alongside policies to boost industrialization and domestic production, will further expand
market participation. However, to encourage market participation, it is important to review and
reduce the regulation and bureaucratic procedures that are restricting participation in the capital
market.
29 The market capitalization, amounting to Nu. 59,077.402 million, is as of January 31, 2025.
46
3.9 Conclusion
The monetary and financial sector of Bhutan remains a cornerstone of economic stability and
growth. However, the monetary policy framework, anchored by Ngultrum’s peg to the INR, limits
RMA’s ability to manage inflation and interest rates. This challenge is compounded by inflation
volatility, particularly in food prices, highlighting Bhutan’s vulnerability to external shocks.
Addressing these risks requires fiscal interventions and structural reforms, including strengthening
domestic food production and supply chain efficiencies.
While the expansion of broad money supply and private sector credit reflects financial sector
growth, the concentration of credit in housing, tourism, and manufacturing raises concerns over
sectoral imbalances. High NPLs in transport, agriculture, and housing further indicate financial
stability risks, necessitating stronger credit risk management. Liquidity conditions are expected to
remain a challenge, making the reinstatement of liquidity management tools essential for stability.
Further, high interest rate spread between lending and borrowing must also be addressed, since
high interest rate spread only calls for government interventions through concessional credit that
is distorting the financing market.
Despite steady progress, Bhutan’s capital market remains underdeveloped and heavily
concentrated in the FIs, limiting diversification. Expanding market participation beyond FIs to
include manufacturing, tourism, and SMEs is imperative for fostering deeper financial market
development and long-term economic resilience. Easing the regulation and bureaucratic process
should improve access to the capital market resulting in market diversification.
Moving forward, Bhutan’s monetary and financial authorities must focus on strengthening the
effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, diversifying credit allocation, addressing sectoral
NPL challenges, and fostering broader capital market participation. A strategic and well-balanced
approach combining prudent regulatory oversight with economic diversification will be crucial in
sustaining financial stability and promoting sustainable economic growth.

Chapter 4:
External Sector: Situation and Outlook
4.1 Introduction
Global trade dynamics in 2025 are characterized by policy uncertainty with governments in major
economies implementing protectionist trade measures. In addition, geopolitical tensions in
Ukraine and the Middle East could impact the energy and commodity prices. Accordingly, the
IMF has projected a slowdown in global trade volumes. Amidst this, there is a shift in global trade
and investment patterns with India emerging as a key player. These global trends present
challenges and opportunities for a small economy like Bhutan who continues to face significant
external imbalances.
Bhutan continues to face a persistent current account deficit, driven by its reliance on imports,
external grants, and borrowings. The country’s current account deficit is projected to reach 11.81
percent of GDP in FY 2024/25 and 8.62 percent in FY 2025/26, necessitating sustained capital and
financial inflows, primarily in the form of grants and external borrowings, to bridge the gap. As
such, the current account deficit is being financed through increase in inflows in the capital and
financial account in the medium term for implementation of 13th FYP and accelerated hydropower
development.
While the foreign reserves position is expected to improve in FY 2024/25, reaching US$ 971.537
million, and further in the medium term, this growth will largely stem from the accumulation of
convertible currency reserves, whereas INR reserves are projected to decline. With limited export
base, the buildup is also the result of inflows of grants and borrowings and as such, the economy
remains vulnerable to external shocks, which can be exacerbated by global policy uncertainty.
Therefore, maintaining an adequate reserve ratio to support the pegged exchange rate remains
crucial to absorb external shocks.
The current account deficit will persist in the external sector albeit with some improvements and
there is a positive outlook on the reserves position. However, the external sector continues to
exhibit structural weaknesses in the economy.
4.2 Global Trade Dynamics
According to the IMF (2025), there is a downward revision in global trade volumes in anticipation
of intensified protectionist trade policies that may come in the form of tariffs and other trade
barriers that will discourage investment, disrupt supply chain and the trade flows. The economic
policy uncertainty along with geopolitical tensions from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and
Ukraine could further impact the commodity and energy prices putting an inflationary pressure,
exacerbating macroeconomic challenges (IMF, 2025).
48
At the same time, a shift in global trade and investment patterns is emerging, with increased
investment and flows in India, Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East while China and Russia
experience decline in investment (Seong, et al., 2024). India is emerging as a key player, attracting
increased investment from Asia, the US and Europe as exemplified by increased energy imports
from Russia and exports of electronics and refined petroleum products to the US and Europe.
These trends indicate a growing integration of India into global production networks.
For Bhutan, a small relatively closed economy30 with heavy reliance on imports of goods, with
India as the primary trading partner, these global developments present both challenges and
opportunities. While the macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures pose risks that
require enhanced capacity to absorb external shocks, India’s emergence as a major player in global
trade networks could benefit Bhutan, given the strong trading relationship and access/proximity to
the Indian market which would require diversification.
4.3 Balance of Payment
The overall balance of payment in FY 2024/25 is projected to have a surplus of Nu. 28,112.466
million, an upward revision from Nu. 12,586.276 million projected in the previous quarter.
4.3.1 Current Account Balance
The Current Account Deficit (CAD) has been persistent, highlighting the structural issues of
supply-side weaknesses. The Current Account Balance (CAB) in FY 2024/25 is projected to
improve by 16 percent compared to the projection of the same period from the previous year. The
improvement is primarily driven by upward revision in service exports during the current quarter
of FY 2024/25 compared to the projection from the same quarter in FY 2023/24.
Comparing quarter to quarter projections, the CAD is expected to improve by 40.91 percent, to
Nu. 35,442.188 million in FY 2024/25 (11.81 percent of GDP) compared to the previous quarter
projection of Nu. 59,975.084 million (19.90 percent of GDP). The improvement in the CAD is on
account of improvement in services and secondary income accounts. The service import is
projected to decline compared to the previous projection by 34.49 percent as a result of downward
revision in education related travels mainly attributed to the reduction in exodus rate.
The secondary income is expected to improve due to projected increase in inward remittances.
Inward remittance from Countries Other than India (COTI) is projected at Nu. 17,566.557 million,
an increase of more than 100 percent compared to previous quarter projection of Nu. 8,697.674
million. As of September 2024, an inward remittance of Nu. 5,269.938 million was recorded from
COTI. This indicates an increased number of Bhutanese residing abroad (net migration) with the
per-capita remittances in FY 2024/25 projected at Nu. 22,601.665, up from Nu. 11,471.862. There
are no inward remittances recorded from India.
30 Strong capital control and significant barriers with countries other than India.
49
Figure 22: Current Account Balance Update
The medium-term outlook projects an improvement in current account, which is attributed to the
bond redemption in FY 2025/26 and FY 2026/27. Additionally, the hydropower export is projected
to increase, bolstered by the commissioning of PHP-II. The CAD is projected to improve to 8.62
percent and 6.80 percent of GDP in FY 2025/26 and FY 2026/27, respectively, before worsening
in FY 2027/28 to 12.31 percent. This alludes to the fact that the structural CAD is not yet addressed
and the supply-side weakness still persists. If this continues, it will lead to Bhutan resorting to
more external borrowings to finance the external imbalance.
While a deficit can be beneficial depending on the composition of imports, and their impact on
growth, the relationship between the CAB and drivers of economic growth suggests underlying
issues. Long-term growth drivers (discussed in Chapter 8) indicate a decline in capital productivity
across industries, which offsets labor productivity gains. This reinforces the view that Bhutan’s
high CAD reflects inefficient allocation of resources and deeper structural challenges within the
economy.
4.3.1.1 Merchandise Trade31
The trade deficit is projected to increase to Nu. 58,220.517 in FY 2024/25, which is 6.70 percent
higher than the previous quarter projections. This is mainly driven by an increase in import of
merchandise goods from India, projected to increase to Nu. 117,369.798 million, which is 3.13
percent higher than previous projection. Import of goods from India for 2024 was projected at Nu.
85,491 million in the previous quarter, while the provisional data recorded an import of Nu.
31 The merchandise trade deficit details and projections in this section is based on the Department of Revenue and Customs. The
trade deficit projection in this section differs from trade balance under current account balance which is RMA’s projection based
on BoP data.
50
92,090.388 million, which is higher by 8 percent. As a result, the baseline revision for 2024 also
led to an increase in the projected import for FY 2024/25.
Quarter on quarter comparison of trade data indicate that merchandise trade deficit (excluding
electricity) in the current quarter worsened by 26.02 percent compared to the previous quarter. The
increase in trade deficit is mainly on account of an increase in imports from COTI by 53.51 percent,
from Nu. 4,368.116 million to Nu. 6,705.506 million in the first quarter and second quarter,
respectively. This is attributed to increased import of data processing machines in the second
quarter. In the same quarter, import from India also increased by 11.16 percent while export
improved marginally by 4.48 percent.
Figure 23: Trade Statistics Update
The merchandise trade deficit (excluding electricity) recorded an improvement of 4.18 percent
from Nu. 70,573.029 million in 2023 to Nu. 67,623.440 million in 2024. The improvement in trade
deficit is mainly on account of improvement in merchandise trade with COTI by 59.46 percent.
The imports from COTI have shown a volatile trend in recent years. There has been a stable upward
trend in import of goods from COTI since 2018, increasing at 18.32 percent on average between
2019-2021. However, it recorded a sharp spike in 2022, when import surged by 77.46 percent, but
has since declined by 27.47 percent on average in 2023 and 2024. On the other hand, the trade
deficit with India worsened in 2024 compared to 2023 by 9 percent.
Bhutan’s trade pattern indicates that it imports from approximately 83 nations but exports to only
about half that number, totaling 34 countries in 2024.32 Trade is highly concentrated with its top
10 trading partners, accounting for 97.52 percent of total trade, of which 84.28 percent is with
India. In terms of total imports, 84.89 percent is sourced from India while 79.52 percent of total
32 This is based on provisional trade statistics data from DRC, MoF for goods and electricity trade sourced from MFCTC
51
exports goes to India. Among its top 10 trading partners, Bhutan had a trade surplus with only 4
of them. The highest trade surplus is with Bangladesh of Nu. 5,080.24 million, followed by South
Korea (Nu. 1,078.37 million), Nepal (Nu. 402.94 million) and the US (Nu. 100.22 million). The
trade surplus with these countries is driven by a narrow range of export commodities primarily
iron and steel, mineral products (boulders and gypsum) and vegetable products (cardamom). This
reflects a limited and low value export base as exhibited by the export of boulders and gypsum.
Additionally, iron and steel exports will be dependent on the global market, with Bhutan facing
competition from large players like China and India, making it vulnerable to price volatility and
global demand. Similarly, cardamom exports and other agricultural products face competition.
Figure 24: Trade Patterns with top trading partners (excl. India)
In the medium term, the trade deficit is projected to worsen in FY 2025/26 and FY 2026/27 mainly
resulting from worsening trade deficit projected with India. The import of goods is expected to
increase from India taking into consideration the anticipated imports for new hydropower
developments.
Figure 25: Balance of Trade Projections
52
4.3.1.2 Terms of Trade
Terms of trade (TOT) measures the ratio of export prices to import prices which provides an
indication of a country’s economic health. Bhutan’s TOT has fluctuated over the past decade, with
a deterioration observed after 2018 signaling increasing import costs relative to export earnings.
The TOT index peaked in 2017 (102.51) and 2018 (101.87), reflecting positive terms of trade.
However, there’s been a downward trend since then, with a sharp decline from 99.69 in 2021 to
86.01 in 2023. This decline can be attributed to the rising import costs of mineral products, metals
and chemical products, which have been exacerbated by global inflation and supply chain
disruptions. On the other hand, the export prices did not see a corresponding rise as shown in
Figure 26.
In 2024, the TOT showed a slight improvement of 87.06, up from 86.01 in 2023. This was
primarily driven by improved export prices of metals and metal articles. However, overall, TOT
remains well below 100, suggesting that the export earnings are not sufficient to fund imports,
leading to a worsening in the trade balance.

4.3.2 Capital Account Balance
The capital account balance in FY 2024/25 is projected at Nu. 9,949.878 million, an increase of
14.75 percent compared to the projection from the same period in the previous fiscal year. The
capital account inflow is anticipated from the disbursement for the hydropower projects and
budgetary grants for investment, of which 86.53 percent of the capital inflows is projected from
India. In the medium term, the capital account is expected to see further growth, driven by
increased inflow of grants as the implementation of the 13th FYP reaches its peak. This period will
also coincide with the significant advancement in hydropower development.
At present, the capital account substantially contributes in supporting the balance of payments and
the accumulation of reserves. While strengthening the capital account is necessary in the short to
medium term to maintain external balance, long-term reliance on it is unsustainable. Therefore, it
is important that the supply-side should be boosted to reduce the CAD and the subsequent shock
on the reserves.
4.3.3 Financial Account Balance
The net financial inflows in FY 2024/25 is projected at Nu. 53,604.776 million, which is 1.50
percent lower than the previous quarter projection. The slight revision is on account of downward
revision in FDI while external borrowings have been revised upwards. This implies that the net
financial inflows to finance the CAD is not on account of FDI, but rather external borrowings.

Figure 27: Balance of Payment Projection
In the medium term, net financial inflow is projected to decline on account of increased trade credit
before increasing in FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28 driven by increase in hydropower and budgetary
external borrowings. However, since this is a financial account, it needs to be noted that at a later
54
date, the principal will need to be re-paid along with interest. Thus, for a sustainable financial
account, there has to be a shift from external borrowings towards FDI inflows.
4.3.3.1 Foreign Direct Investment
The FDI is projected at Nu. 4,833.227 million in FY 2024/25, a downward revision by 18.85
percent compared to the previous quarter projection. The FDI in the medium term is projected to
improve at a stable rate of 5 percent annually.33 Currently, most FDI inflows in Bhutan are
concentrated in the high-end tourism market and other sectors, which are relatively mature
compared to other industries. While efforts to promote FDI have been ongoing for nearly 2
decades, the actual inflow of FDI has been limited due to various factors, including regulatory
constraints. With the decline in capital productivity and stagnation of TFP, FDI has to be
prioritized as a tool for enhancing productivity rather than means to attract foreign currency
inflows.
The 13th FYP targets a FDI of Nu. 500 billion, which would be a challenge given the current
trajectory. Nevertheless, an Economic Development Board (EDB) chaired by the Hon’ble Prime
Minister has been instituted to streamline and expedite foreign investment. This initiative aims to
minimize bureaucratic hurdles, reduce regulatory complexities, and eliminate red tape, thereby
fostering a more efficient investment environment that could result in increased inflow of FDI.
Global experience suggests that fostering FDI requires a balanced approach, including
streamlining regulations and adopting measured capital control policies. Traditionally, FDI in
Bhutan has been promoted through fiscal incentives, but such policy instruments create a
distortionary effect in the market, displacing the domestic industries against already competitive
foreign investors. Thus, it is imperative that should Bhutan want to enhance productivity within
the shortest duration, FDI has to be prioritized by providing the right incentives without impacting
the domestic industries.
4.4 Foreign Reserves
Bhutan’s foreign reserve position is projected to improve to US$ 971.537 million at the end of FY
2024/25, by 19 percent compared to previous quarter projections on account of improvements in
the current account. This is enough to finance 25 months of essential imports. As of 25th January,
2025, the external reserves amounted to US$ 866.060 million (RMA, 2025), fulfilling the
constitutional requirement of maintaining 12 months of essential imports.34
33 Estimates do not take into account the anticipated inflows for GMC.
34Essential imports are valued at US$ 464 million.
55
Figure 28: Foreign Reserves Position
While the overall foreign reserve is expected to improve over the medium term, it is worth noting
that the projected buildup in the foreign reserve is driven by improvements in CC reserve position,
whereas, the INR reserves position is expected to decline. This creates a potential mismatch, as
India remains Bhutan’s primary trading partner, exposing Bhutan to exchange rate fluctuations
risks and higher transaction costs as CC reserves are converted into INR to finance imports from
India. While this is not a major concern yet, improving INR earnings will help mitigate any
potential exchange rate shocks.35
4.5 Exchange Rate
Bhutan’s fixed exchange rate regime of pegging BTN to INR provides price stability and reduces
transaction costs in light of India’s role as the primary trading partner. In this regard, BTN mirrors
the INR’s nominal exchange rate trends. The nominal exchange rate shows that the value of BTN
against USD depreciated marginally from Nu. 81.611 in FY 2022/23 to Nu. 83.102 in FY 2023/24
as shown in Figure 29. This depreciation has dual implications: it increases the cost of imports
from COTI and at the same time, potentially enhancing the competitiveness of Bhutanese exports.
This is particularly significant given the recent spikes seen in import of goods from COTI which
exerts further pressure on reserves. However, Bhutan’s reliance on imported raw materials and the
resulting increase in production costs undermine the competitiveness in export market that would
result from currency depreciation.
35 Rupee crunch
56
Figure 29: Nominal Exchange Rate (Nu/USD)
Source: Monthly Statistical Bulletin, January 2025
The pegged currency regime with lower overall productivity as compared to India results in
overvaluation of BTN while looking at the Real Exchange Rate (RER), which accounts for relative
price levels for Bhutan and India. Historically, the RER is estimated to be more than 1 indicating
an overvaluation of the BTN relative to the INR. This made Bhutanese goods and services
relatively more expensive and also placed pressures on the INR reserve position. However, there
was a significant shift in 2024, where the RER declined to approximately 0.983 signaling an
undervaluation of the BTN. This may be a result of the CPI rebasing done in May 2024, as RER
is normally expected to shift on account of structural changes within the economy through
improved competitiveness and enhanced productivity.
Figure 30: Real Exchange Rate (Nu/INR)
57
As domestic electricity demand increases, the reduction in exports could result in a further
deterioration in the economy’s competitiveness especially if this does not translate into a
proportionate increase in the export of other products which use electricity as an input. It is also
essential to address the transfer pricing issues so that the economic entity operating within
Bhutanese territory contributes meaningfully in enhancing the productiveness and competitiveness
of Bhutan with the rest of the world. Such effort will result in strengthening and maintaining
stability of the Bhutanese currency to absorb external shocks.
4.6 International Investment Position
The net International Investment Position (IIP) of Bhutan stands at negative US$ 4,199.432 million
at the end of June 2024. The total financial assets amounted to US$ 496.986 million, a decrease of
29.70 percent from June 2023. Reserve assets represent the majority of the asset (49.42 percent)
which has declined by 55.64 percent from the previous year. This provides a buffer to absorb
external shocks but the decline could put pressure on maintaining adequate reserves. On the other
hand, total external financial liabilities increased by 1.00 percent from US$ 4,649.882 million in
the previous year to US$ 4,696.419 million. The increase was mainly driven by the loans, which
increased from US$ 4,363.127 million in June 2023 to US$ 4,423.797 million, comprising 94.20
percent of the total liabilities.

4.7 Conclusion
Bhutan’s external sector outlook in 2025 is marked by both improvements and persistent
vulnerabilities. The structural CAD is projected to decline to 11.81 percent of GDP in FY 2024/25
and improve to 8.62 percent in FY 2025/26. Although high, the decline is on account of lower
service imports and high remittance inflows, with subsequent improvement in foreign reserves.
However, structural trade imbalances and a reliance on external borrowings underscore
weaknesses and lack of productivity in the economy. Strengthening competitiveness through
addressing the structural issues remains critical to maintaining an adequate reserve ratio for
macroeconomic stability.
The trade deficit is expected to widen due to rising imports, from both India and COTI. In 2024,
exports to COTI increased by 43.88 percent, but the overall trade deficit remained high due to a
surge in trade deficit with India by 21.91 percent. Key import drivers include mineral fuels, and
data processing machines, comprising 19.27 percent and 10.55 percent of merchandise imports,
respectively. The CAD is financed through improvement in capital and financial account, with
external borrowing and grants, financing about 67 percent of the deficit. Nevertheless, FDI, which
is an important source of improving productivity and production know-how in the economy,
remains low at just 1.8 percent of GDP.
The continued depreciation of the Ngultrum, coupled with Bhutan’s dependency on India for trade,
necessitates policy interventions to mitigate external shocks. Further, the deterioration of terms of
trade represents erosion of consumer purchasing power, worsening of trade deficit, and reduced
competitiveness constraining the growth. Going forward, enhancing export diversification,
strengthening foreign investment inflows, and managing external debt prudently will be critical in
ensuring Bhutan’s macroeconomic stability and long-term resilience in an increasingly uncertain
global trade environment. More importantly, it is crucial that Bhutan address the supply-side
weaknesses to increase production within the economy to address the structural CAD.

Chapter 5:
Household and Labor Market
5.1 Introduction
Bhutan’s economy has experienced significant structural shifts over the past few decades,
transitioning from a predominantly agrarian society to one increasingly reliant on industry and
services. Despite these changes, the labor market transformation has not kept pace with the
evolution of the goods market. While agriculture still dominates the labor force, accounting for
over 41% of employment, its contribution to GDP has declined significantly. The lack of proper
industrialization and stagnation of the service sector have created limited productive employment
opportunities, particularly for the growing youth population. This mismatch has resulted in
persistent youth unemployment, a pressing issue for policymakers, as well as challenges in labor
market integration.
The shift away from agriculture is evident in Bhutan’s evolving employment landscape, with the
services sector becoming the second-largest employer, now producing over 50% of the economy's
output. However, productivity in both the industrial and service sectors remain low, hindering
overall economic growth. Despite some progress in agricultural productivity through modern
farming techniques, rural areas remain highly dependent on agriculture, with limited access to
economic opportunities. This has led to a widening rural-urban divide, with urban areas benefitting
from better employment prospects while rural regions face higher poverty and lower standards of
living.
Social progress in Bhutan has been mixed. While poverty levels are gradually declining, significant
disparities remain between urban and rural areas. Urban areas benefit from greater access to
employment and economic resources, while rural communities face challenges such as inadequate
infrastructure and limited market access. This disparity is mirrored in educational outcomes, with
urban areas showing higher literacy rates and income levels. Additionally, with a declining fertility
rate and increasing life expectancy, Bhutan could face an aging society, posing long-term
economic challenges. A disparity between rural and urban calls for targeted government
interventions rather than blanket government spending that is resulting in low productivity and
economic opportunities.
5.2 Structural Transformation of Labor Market
Structural transformation of a growing economy is marked by the transition from a low-
productivity, labor-intensive sector to a higher-productivity, skill-intensive sector. Such shifts will
enhance the labor output ratio, thus, enhancing their income and improving their standard of living.
Although Bhutan’s labor market has experienced notable structural shifts over the past few
decades, it has not kept up with the structural changes in the goods market.
60
Figure 31 illustrates that the goods market has undergone a structural transformation in Bhutan,
with an agricultural-dependent economy in the 1990s gradually shifting towards industry and
services, with a more significant shift towards the latter. On the other hand, the labor market has
not seen a proportionate shift with over 41 percent of the labor market still dependent on
agriculture, while contributing only 13 percent to the GDP. However, the gradual adoption of
modern farming techniques, improved seed varieties and machinery has led to gradual increases
in labor productivity. Despite these improvements, the sector's relatively low share of total GDP
means its overall impact on the broader economy remains limited.
Figure 31: Structural Transformation of the Economy
Laborers who moved away from the agriculture sector, were absorbed into the transportation,
wholesale and retail, construction and community services. While such a sector initially fosters
labor mobility and boosts productivity, jobs in such sectors may be less stable and offer lower
wages, especially in developing economies like Bhutan. This will ultimately lead to a halt in
productivity gains, resulting in stagnation of the overall economy.
Unlike typical economic structural transformation paths of industrialized countries, whereby the
economy transitions from an agrarian to an industrial economy and then to services, in Bhutan’s
case, the services sector has attracted much of the labor that has moved away from the agriculture
sector. From employing just about 20 percent of the total labor force in 1990, the services sector
is now the second largest employer producing over 50 percent of the total output. The output per
labor in the service sector has increased gradually since 2010, offering more productive
employment. However, it is observed that the output per labor in the industry sector has been
declining since 2010, as industrialization has not fully taken root in the economy. Given the
industry sector’s potential to provide productive employment, the lack of progress in this sector is
a key reason for persistently high youth unemployment in Bhutan.
61
Figure 32: Output per Labor (Index = 2010)
Bhutan’s structural transformation illustrates a disconnect between the evolution of the labor
market and the changes occurring in the goods market. Considering the deindustrialization of the
economy and the service sector stagnation due to the slow recovery of the tourism sector, the
availability of productive employment in the economy still remains a challenge. This is one of the
structural challenges for Bhutan which needs to be addressed within the 13th FYP.
5.3 Labor Market Dynamics
5.3.1 Employment
The employment rate in 2024 remained stable, averaging 96.5 percent, same as the previous year.
Statistics show that rural areas have higher employment as compared to urban areas given that
much of the subsistence form of agricultural practices are rural-based, where a majority of the
labor force is concentrated. Although various initiatives were undertaken to transition from
subsistence farming to commercial agriculture, the lack of proper logistics, supply and value chain,
and market integration has resulted in failure of such programs. On the other hand, urban areas
have a higher concentration of employment in managerial and professional services.
Figure 33: Employment Rate (%)
62
5.3.2 Sectoral Labor Share
In 2024, the total employment across all sectors was recorded at 369,298. Agriculture and forestry
had the highest share, accounting for nearly 41 percent of total employment, followed by public
administration and defense, which comprised 18 percent. Over the coming years, total employment
is projected to increase steadily, reaching 393,532 by 2028, as shown in Figure 34.
Figure 34: Employment by Sectors
The projected sectoral shifts in employment indicate further transformation of the labor market.
The share of employment in agriculture and forestry is expected to decline by 11.55 percent from
2024-2028, reflecting a gradual move away from the agricultural sectors, a trend observed globally
(L. Tupy & Bailey, 2023). Similarly, private household employment is projected to decrease by
23.64 percent. On the other hand, the share of employment in construction is expected to increase
by 61.57 percent, financial intermediation by 52.99 percent, transport and communications by
26.99 percent, and electricity, gas and water supply by 78.42 percent, reflecting a shift toward
high-productivity industries.
While the agriculture sector will remain a key component of the Bhutanese economy, a gradual
shift towards industry and services is expected to lead to higher household incomes and improved
living standards. However, this shift is likely to drive continued youth migration from rural to
urban areas. To address this, prioritizing interventions that enhance the rural economy and bridge
the rural-urban divide is crucial. This could include investments in agricultural technology,
agribusiness, rural education, social infrastructure, and modern farming practices, creating
lucrative and sustainable employment opportunities for youth in rural areas.
63
5.3.3 Unemployment
The unemployment rate in 2024 has steadily declined from the first quarter bringing the overall
average unemployment rate to 3.5 percent. Unemployment remains higher in urban areas
compared to rural areas, as people from rural areas migrate to cities in search of work.
Figure 35: Unemployment Rate (%)
The unemployment rate for 2025 is projected to increase slightly to 3.7 percent, up from 3.5
percent in 2024. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the labor force base, driven by the
expansion in the working-age population.36 However, after 2025, unemployment is expected to
decline to 3.0 percent down from 3.7 percent in the previous year. This can be attributed to sectoral
employment growth due to improved economic activities as 13th FYP spending peaks in the mid
of the plan period.
5.3.4 Youth Unemployment Rate
The average youth unemployment rate for 2024 stands at 19.1 percent, with the highest recorded
in the first quarter at 22.9 percent which showed a gradual decline in the subsequent quarters.
Urban youth unemployment is higher than rural youth unemployment, reflecting the concentration
of jobseekers in the urban areas.
36 Over 70,000 youths will enter the job market in 13th FYP.
64
Figure 36: Youth Unemployment Rate (%)
Consistent high youth unemployment can cause major issues in an economy. First, the longer the
youth remain unemployed during their productive age, their skills become obsolete thus making
them uncompetitive in the job market and leading to productivity loss for the entire society.
Second, socially, having high youth unemployment indicates a lack of a dynamic economy that is
unable to absorb the growing youth population. As a result, this could dampen future expectation
and consequently hamper long-term human capital accumulation. Third, higher youth
unemployment will increase dependency ratio for the working population, whereby a smaller
working population has to support a larger non-working population. Finally, a more recent and
direct consequence of consistent youth unemployment within Bhutan is the increasing number of
youth seeking opportunities abroad, leading to loss of skilled and educated work force. This loss
of talent weakens the nation’s workforce and undermines its potential for sustainable economic
development.
The persistent high youth unemployment, due to significant growth in youth entering the labor
market since 2009, remains a major challenge facing Bhutan This is a symptom of an underlying
problem of a lack of dynamic economy. Additionally, the adoption of a capital-intensive growth
model with an underdeveloped private sector as a result of cumbersome regulation, has resulted in
a single sector driven growth – namely hydropower. It is pertinent that economic diversification
be prioritized and the growth is led by the private sector.
5.4 Household Financial Status and Debt
Household income and expenditure are the key indicators of economic well-being, indicating
living standards, and shaping broader economic trends. In 2022, the monthly average household
expenditure was Nu. 52,813 while the monthly average household income was Nu. 33,845;
highlighting the disparity between household income and expenditure (NSB, 2022). A large
portion of the household’s income is allocated for food and non-food consumption.
65
From 2023, the average monthly household income is expected to increase by about 10.41 percent
over the next few years. This is expected as a result of the labor market transition, which indicates
a decline in employment in the agricultural sector by 11.55 percent and a corresponding
employment increase in the industry and service sectors which are deemed more productive and
have higher income opportunities.
Figure 37: Household Expenditure, Income and Debt
The significant rise in the household income during the year 2023 can be attributed to the
substantial pay hike for the civil servants, SOEs and corporate organizations. Additionally, the
revision of the National Workforce Wage Rates, which saw an increase of approximately 85
percent, has also contributed to the spike in household income.
While such revisions boosted the household income, if the increase does not come with increased
productivity, it will either exert inflationary pressure or external imbalance. Further, while this
increase in earnings strengthens financial stability for those in the formal sector, rural households
– which largely depend on agriculture may not have experienced the same level of income growth.
Similarly, household expenditure is also expected to increase over the years. The average monthly
household expenditure is expected to increase by 23.67 percent by 2028. This can be attributed to
growing demand for goods and services which may drive up prices and the cost of living.
As seen in Figure 37, in 2023, the household debt decreased significantly compared to the previous
year, primarily due to the major pay hike and the revision of the national wage rate, which boosted
the household income. However, going ahead, household debt is projected to increase over the
years, indicating that the households are spending more than what they earn. This rise in debt
reflects an increasing gap between the household income and expenditure, likely driven by
inflation, higher consumption needs and change in lifestyle choices. With the growing gap,
households are more likely to borrow as their income growth may not keep pace with the rising
expenditures. At moderate levels, debt can boost welfare and stimulate growth, but excessive debt
66
can be harmful. Thus, it will be imperative to monitor the sources and level of debt availed by
households to bridge the gap.
Figure 38: Sources of Loans for Households; Rural and Urban
Of the total households in the country, 42 percent of households availed loans, among which, bank
loans (loans from deposit taking financial institutions) are the most common source (35.9 percent
of all loans). The distribution of loan sources between rural and urban households in Bhutan during
the year 2022, presented in Figure 38 shows that urban areas tend to have better access to a diverse
range of financial institutions with higher levels of loans from sources such as NPPF and insurance
companies. On the other hand, rural households show a heavier reliance on microfinance loans
(0.71 percent), and CSI loans (2.24 percent) compared to urban households. This implies a rural-
urban difference in financial service accessibility, with urban areas having more diverse financing
options while rural areas rely more on specialized lending programs such as micro-finance and
CSI loans targeted at small businesses and agricultural activities.
5.5 Social Progress
5.5.1 Poverty
The poverty rate which had been declining has seen a slight disruption due to the pandemic.
However, it is expected to gradually decline to 8.09 percent by 2028. Considering the time lag of
the impact of 13th FYP spending to trickle down to the grassroot level, the rate of decline will
initially be slow but is expected to accelerate towards the end of the plan.
67
Figure 39: Poverty Rate
Poverty levels in Bhutan reveal a huge disparity between urban and rural areas. Urban areas have
significantly lower poverty rates, which can be attributed largely to better access to employment
and economic opportunities. Urban households benefit from proximity to the market, better
knowledge and information, along with convenient logistics and infrastructure, which collectively
contribute to improved living standards and economic stability.
In contrast, rural poverty remains consistently higher throughout the projection period, higher than
12 percentage points on average as compared to urban poverty. This can be attributed to the
concentration of agriculture farming as the dominant occupation in rural areas and limited
economic opportunities. Dependence on farming exposes rural households to vulnerabilities such
as climate shocks, human-wild life conflicts, limited market accesses and lower productivity, all
of which contribute to higher poverty levels. Boosting agricultural productivity, which can be
achieved through investment in modern farming techniques, logistic, supply and value chain
development, and market conforming interventions, could not only reduce rural poverty but also
substantially increase living standards.
5.5.2 Literacy and Life Expectancy
Bhutan has made significant progress in enhancing its human capital, evident through the increase
seen in the literacy rate and life expectancy. Over the past two decades, the literacy rate has
increased from 70.42 percent in urban and 36.50 percent in rural areas to 82.7 percent and 63.1
percent, respectively, by 2022. This trend is expected to continue, with literacy rates projected to
rise to 85 percent in urban areas and 66 percent in rural areas by 2028.
With the increase in literacy rate, individuals are more likely to access better health information,
adopt healthier lifestyles, and make informed decisions about their well-being contributing to
better health outcomes and enhancing their life expectancy. As a result, Bhutan’s life expectancy
68
at birth has reached 71.3 years, with male life expectancy at 69.9 years and female life expectancy
at 72.8 years (UNFPA, 2022).
Figure 40: Size of Population w.r.t Income and Literacy Rate
Figure 40 shows the size of population in various Dzongkhags plotted with respect to its income
and literacy rate. As expected, Thimphu has the largest population with the highest level of income
and one of the highest literacy rates in the country, which is followed by Paro. Contrary to
Thimphu, Tsirang has one of the lowest incomes with lowest level of literacy rate in the country,
followed by Haa, Pema Gatshel and Dagana. While the causality between literacy rate and income
is not evident, a certain degree of correlation can be observed between the two in the graph, which
is also widely supported by the literature (Wadhwa & Palakkandy, 2024).
5.5.3 Replacement Rate - Birth Rate and TFR
It is a common phenomenon across the world to observe that as the household income increases,
the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) – birth per woman – declines, as a result it is common to see an
aging society. This relationship is illustrated in the chart below, whereby the countries are graphed
with respect to their fertility rate and human development index. Bhutan can be found amongst a
low fertility rate while having a much lower human development index.37
37 See Fertility Rate - Our World in Data
69
Figure 41: Fertility Rate Vs. Human Development Index, 2022
Source: Our World in Data
Bhutan faces a unique phenomenon of low fertility rate while still being a lower middle-income
country. Combining this with increased life expectancy, Bhutan faces the risk of an aging society
with a relatively low living standard country unlike other aging societies, which have high living
standards. As the current working age group retires, the burden on the future working generation
will be higher to support the social programs associated with the retired population. By 2032, the
TFR is projected to decline to 1.7 births per woman, from 4.7 in 2000. The poor aging society will
be a constraint for future growth prospects and will impose considerable social challenges.
5.6 Conclusion
While over 41 percent of the labor force is still dependent on agriculture, the labor market is
expected to see a shift towards the industrial and service sectors. Despite this, labor absorption into
more productive sectors still remains a challenge due to the lack of productive industrial
development and economic diversification. The projected decline in agricultural employment
reflects a slow structural shift, while sectors such as construction, financial intermediaries,
transport and communication are expected to experience growth. While urban areas continue to
experience higher unemployment, the overall unemployment is projected to increase slightly to
70
3.7 percent in 2025, before stabilizing at 3 percent in the following years; with total employment
projected to reach 393,532 by 2028.
Household income and expenditure trends highlight disparities between urban and rural areas.
Rural households remain heavily dependent on agriculture with lower and less stable incomes,
while urban households benefit from higher and more reliable incomes from formal employment.
With the shift to higher paying sectors in the medium term, household income is expected to
increase, and at the same time expenditure will also grow due to inflation and higher consumption.
Bhutan has made progress in reducing poverty, with the rate expected to return to 8 percent by
2028, while rural poverty continues to be a persistent challenge. Literacy rates have improved,
with urban areas reaching 82 percent in 2022, compared to 63 percent in rural areas. Life
expectancy also shows a positive trend reaching 71.3 years in 2022. However, Bhutan faces
demographic challenges including an aging population and declining fertility rate, which could
strain future economic growth. Thus, Bhutan’s economic trajectory requires efforts to foster
productive job creation, support sectoral diversification, and address the long-term challenges.

Chapter 6:
Industrial Development
6.1 Introduction
Bhutan’s industrial sector has seen a lopsided development, primarily driven by hydropower, and
mining and quarrying. These resource-based industries have experienced substantial growth, with
the electricity sector growing at an average rate of 48 percent between 1981-2023. However,
private sector participation remains limited and contributes marginally to economic growth with
only a few large industries and the dominance of CSI. Thus, the manufacturing industry remains
underdeveloped and consistently lags behind in comparison to neighboring economies.
Competition within Bhutan’s industrial sector is uneven, with large-scale industries dominating
market share while CSIs face high competition and scaling challenges. Competition is measured
by using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to investigate the competitiveness of the domestic
market. HHI indicates that smaller firms operate in highly competitive environments, particularly
in segments with low market entry barriers. Meanwhile, industries requiring significant investment
and technical expertise, such as mining and large-scale manufacturing, exhibit higher market
concentration and limited competition.
While different market segments display moderate to high competition, enhancing industrial
diversification and promoting innovation will be paramount for Bhutan to integrate into global
value chains. Lessons from industrial transformation in East and South Asia underscore the
potential of manufacturing and technology-driven growth. Countries like South Korea, China, and
Bangladesh have successfully leveraged industrialization for economic transformation. Bhutan can
adopt similar strategies by strengthening its manufacturing base, integrating into global value
chains, and fostering technological advancement.
6.2 Regional Industrial Development
6.2.1 Regional Development - East Asia
Transformation in the economic structure has been observed across all nations undergoing
economic growth and Asia, as a continent, has experienced rapid economic growth in the second
half of the 20th century. East Asian economies such as South Korea, Japan and China experienced
rapid growth in the manufacturing sector. These economies displayed similar changes in the
composition of their output and employment structures, as illustrated in Figure 42, where the share
of manufacturing value added in GDP increased significantly. The share of manufacturing value
added in GDP for Korea increased from around 17.3 percent in the 1960s to more than double, at
37 percent in 1991. Since the 1980s, the Korean manufacturing sector has steadily contributed
72
around 30 percent to GDP.38 The growth also led to a structural shift, whereby, share of
manufacturing employment to the total employment increased significantly (25 percent of total
employment in 1990). This is also seen in the Chinese economy, which benefitted from export-led
industrialization. From 1980 to 2002, the contribution of East Asia to the world market rose from
13 percent to 23 percent, mainly on account of exports originating in China (CEPII, 2005).
However, the dynamic has now shifted from manufacturing output to more technology and scale-
intensive subsectors such as semiconductors, electronics and automotive. While Japan has the
lowest manufacturing share to GDP among the three countries, the nation experienced structural
and economic shifts as the first Asian country to industrialize. Japan’s economic strategy centered
around high savings and investment, thereby fostering a positive cycle of investment, exports, and
manufacturing improvements (ADB, 2018).
Figure 42: Manufacturing Value Added in Korea, Japan, and China (% of GDP)
Source: Data from World Development Indicators
6.2.2 Industrial Development in South Asia and Bhutan
Similarly, South Asian nations, though relatively late to industrialize, have shown significant
development over the recent decades. These nations recognized the need for industrialization,
specifically, manufacturing for high growth rates and mass employment creation. In Bangladesh,
the share of manufacturing value added has increased by more than fourfold, from around 5 percent
in the 1960s to 22 percent in 2023 (WDI, 2025). Bangladesh has been propelled into global export
markets by its garment industry, contributing 57 percent to GDP and 72 percent to employment in
2023 (Akinrebiyo, 2024). Policies like “Make in India” and investments have supported India’s
industrial growth and led it to diversify into high-value manufacturing, IT services, and automobile
38 World Development Indicators, World Bank Group
73
production. The sector is expected to reach US$ 1 trillion by FY 2025/26 (India Brand Equity
Foundation, 2025).
Bhutan’s industrial sector has similarly experienced fast-paced growth, with the industry sector’s
contribution to GDP consistently exceeding 30 percent since the late 1990s. However, the
composition of this growth is heavily skewed towards resource-rich industries, such as hydropower
and mining, while manufacturing value-added remains relatively low compared to other South
Asian nations. As illustrated in Figure 43, manufacturing value added in Bhutan is one of the
lowest, contributing around 8.72 percent in 2022 and around 8.05 percent in 2023 (NSB, 2024).
Figure 43: Manufacturing, Value Added (% GDP) in South Asian Nations (% of GDP)
Source: Data from World Development Indicators
With globalization, economies are now rapidly shifting from the primary sectors to tertiary sector-
oriented growth. The Productivity Databook 2024 finds that Bhutan’s industrial growth is largely
fueled by the service sector, followed by the transport, storage and communication sector while
contribution from the manufacturing sector pales starkly (APO, 2024). On the other hand, industry
origins of economic growth in developing nations such as Bangladesh show a large contribution
of the manufacturing sector towards growth. The report also makes evident that many developing
nations, including Bhutan, are experiencing the simultaneous development of both the service
(tertiary) and manufacturing (secondary) sectors.
The concerning trend in developing industries is where economies experience a decline in the share
of manufacturing output, a phenomenon that is typically observed later in the development
trajectory of advanced economies. This premature shift, i.e. premature deindustrialization, shrinks
the nation’s ability to add value in global value chains and tradable sectors as the manufacturing
industry often serves as an entry point into global markets. Particularly, Bhutan has started
premature deindustrialization since 1996, before even graduating from the low-income country
74
category (APO, 2024). However, the rate of deindustrialization is slow suggesting that the trend
could be reversed with focused effort of developing industries.
6.3 Overview of Industry in Bhutan
Bhutanese industries are categorized by scale and by function (activity). By scale, industries are
segregated into Cottage (Micro), Small, Medium, and Large industries depending on investment
and employment strength. In terms of functionality, the Bhutan Standard Industrial Classification
of 2020 (BSIC 2020) has grouped 21 industries based on economic activities, broadly classified
into Service, Production and Manufacturing, and Contractors. The industrial landscape is mostly
small-scale followed by cottage and medium industries while large-scale industries account for
less than 2 percent of the total industrial strength. This is reminiscent of the global economy where
despite the variance in the classification of industries based on scale; Medium, Small and Medium
Enterprises (MSME) dominate the number of firms. In Asia, MSMEs accounted for 98.7 percent
of all enterprises in 2023 and employed 61.1 percent of the total workforce (ADB, 2024).
Sectoral turnover analysis indicates significant growth across the manufacturing and service
sectors.39 Turnover for the large-scale manufacturing sector has increased by 70.09 percent
between 2016 and 2023. Similar trends are seen across all scales, especially in the cottage (micro)
industries. Micro and small industries have experienced strong turnover growth over the years
(225.39 percent and 67.78 percent, respectively), showing strong and increased competition in
those sections. This trend is mirrored by the service sector, which accounts for 84.81 percent of
total licenses, and experienced an increase in turnover by 42.35 percent during the same period.
Large-scale enterprises remain the primary contributors to industrial turnover while smaller firms
make marginal contributions despite having strength in the number of establishments. This is
further supported by the strong presence of large-scale industries in the production and
manufacturing sectors, such as minerals, which are export-oriented and drive much of the
country’s industrial growth. On the other hand, smaller industries rely on traditional, low-
productivity technologies and serve a limited domestic market (MoICE, 2024).
6.4 Market Concentration and Competition
To evaluate the competitiveness in the Bhutanese market, analysis has been prepared on two levels:
the scale of business and activity, i.e., service, and manufacturing40 using the HHI. The index is a
widely used measure of market concentration and industry competitiveness, and has been
computed to review the degree of competition within select markets and the manufacturing
industry by calculating the sum of the squared market shares of all enterprises in an industry.
39 Due to the unavailability of disaggregated output data, analysis in this chapter is conducted on the sectorial turnover obtained
from corporate and business income tax data since 2016.
40 For the purpose of this report, analysis has been performed on Services and Manufacturing sectors based on annual turnover
data obtained from the Department of Revenue and Custom.
75
Table 12: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index Interpretation Matrix
HHI Value Market Concentration Level of Competition
10,000 Monopoly Very Low
1500 - 10,000 High Low
1500 - 1000 Moderate Medium
0 - 1000 Low High
Source: Matrix built on interpretation of HHI by the U.S. Department of Justice
Analysis of the manufacturing sector reveals that large-scale establishments hold most of the
market share (in terms of turnover), showing that this sector has consistently dominated the market
at high levels, accounting for more than 90 percent of total turnover across 2016 to 2023. MSMEs
hold less than a tenth of the total market but display higher levels of competition as observed in
Figure 44. In comparison, Japanese MSMEs dominated the number of enterprises at 99.7 percent
of the total number of enterprises in 2016 and accounted for around 55 percent of total value added
(METI, 2016). Similarly, as of 2023, MSMEs in South Korea accounted for around 99 percent of
total enterprises and contributed slightly lower at around 46.78 percent to output.41 While Bhutan
and these nations show similarities in terms of composition by scale, Japanese and Korean MSMEs
show a vast difference in their contribution to GDP as compared to the marginal contribution by
Bhutanese MSMEs.
Figure 44: Market Share in Manufacturing by Scale (% Turnover)
The high market concentration among large-scale manufacturers, which account for over 90
percent of total turnover in Bhutan, represents a high barrier to entry. In contrast, MSMEs face
intense competition, which is further reflected in the HHI, as shown in Figure 45, where small
41 Ministry of SME and StartUps, https://www.mss.go.kr/site/eng/02/20202000000002019110610.jsp
76
industries exhibit a high competitiveness level with HHI of 61 in 2023 and micro industries with
HHI of 35. Micro and small industries represent the largest share of industrial licenses accounting
for 70.59 percent (MoICE, 2024). However, within this, industries involved in niche activities
such as manufacturing of mechano-therapy appliances exhibit greater market concentration (few
players) and lower competition due to specialized barriers to entry as the market requires large
investment, subject knowledge, and research and development. High competition faced by small
industries exacerbates the challenges in scaling up.
Figure 45: Time Series of HHI for Manufacturing Industries by Scale
The intense competition among small industries, as reflected in the HHI trends, also extends to
value-added industries in agriculture. As illustrated in Figure 46, the market for value-added
industries in agriculture initially exhibited high market concentration with HHI of 2,500 in 2016
but saw increased competition following the implementation of the CSI Policy 2019 and
investments made in start-up centers. However, since 2022, either market consolidation has re-
emerged or few firms have gone out of business as a result of the pandemic, with the number of
tax-paying manufacturing enterprises declining from 292 in 2022 to 202 in 2023. The Industrial
Census 2024, found that the agricultural value addition and forest-based industries are primarily
rural-based, with a strong reliance on domestic raw materials. The mining sector, which operates
under a highly regulated environment creating significant barriers to entry, displays moderate
market concentration. As illustrated in Figure 47, the sector shows relatively stable competition
over the years. The increase in HHI for 2020 may be linked to the cancellation of mining rights42
during that year.
42Auction of mining rights to Chunaikhola dolomite mine, which was previously held by a private firm was cancelled and taken
over by SMCL.

Agriculture
Figure 48: HHI Index for Other Manufacturing Figure 49: HHI for Service Sectors
The HHI of other manufacturing industries show a gradual increase in market concentration,
peaking in 2020. However, the market segment shows increased competition and market
diversification post COVID-19, with a steeper decline in HHI from 2022, as shown in Figure 48.
In contrast, the service sector demonstrates the low market concentration and high levels of
competition. The sector, depicted in Figure 49, is characterized by a large number of market
participants as the sector is easier to enter, especially in the areas such as hotel and restaurants,
transportation, and wholesale and retail trade. Thus, the analysis reveals that the manufacturing
sector displays moderate to high levels of market concentration, while the service sector has low
market concentration and is highly competitive with a more fragmented market structure. The
small domestic market, coupled with high production costs due to factors like logistics and
infrastructure limitations, hinders the development of competitive manufacturing industries.

6.5 The Bhutanese Industrial Landscape
6.5.1 Current Industrial Situation: Premature Deindustrialization
Bhutan faces limited economies of scale due to its small domestic market,43 which restricts large-
scale industrial production and increases cost. Terrain is another factor that adds to this, increasing
transportation costs with poor logistical facilities. The industrial base is largely fragmented, with
most enterprises being CSIs that lack the technology and capacity for bulk production,
specialization or automation. Additionally, enablers such as industrial parks, roads, and digital
connectivity are still in development, making it difficult for businesses to scale up (MoICE, 2024).
As a result, Bhutan has been facing premature deindustrialization since 1996, where manufacturing
share to value added peaked and has been on a decline since.
Figure 50: Manufacturing Share of Value Added
Source: APO Databook 2024
Premature deindustrialization has several negative consequences. First, it limits Bhutan’s ability
to participate effectively in global value chains, as it contributes insignificantly to total exports in
43The size of the market is not only constrained by the low population, but also hindered by the declining population growth
estimates and low fertility rates (1.4% in 2022) which do not support significant growth.
79
the global market (World Trade Organization, 2022). Manufacturing often serves as a crucial entry
point for developing countries into global markets, allowing them to acquire new technologies,
skills and knowledge. The decline of manufacturing weakens this pathway and restricts Bhutan’s
integration into the global economy, leading to slower productivity growth. Second, manufacturing
industries tend to have higher productivity growth rates compared to other sectors, resulting in
higher income for laborers. Third, to support a productive service sector that is reliant on domestic
consumers, it is essential to have a few highly specialized manufacturing industries to support the
sector. Premature deindustrialization can therefore dampen overall economic growth potential.
The diminishing contribution of the manufacturing sector to economic growth is also observed in
the growth accounting framework built for Bhutan, and discussed in detail in Chapter 8. The
sector’s share-to-economic growth has almost halved to 8.7 percent during 2008-2022, when it
was previously 15.2 percent (1990-2008). Lower contribution from the manufacturing sector
results in higher concentration of employment in the agriculture and service sectors. Technological
development and entrepreneurship are also hindered by premature deindustrialization as the sector
is characterized by both low levels of technological adoption and employment share.
6.5.2 Industrial Gross Output and Value Added
While certain industrial sectors such as manufacturing, mining and quarrying exhibit growth in
value-added and gross-output, the economy as a whole is experiencing deindustrialization with the
share of industry in total value-added stagnating over time. This trend is seen in tandem with the
rapid expansion of the service sector, particularly in areas like tourism and transportation, which
have outpaced the industries in their contribution to GDP and value added, as evidenced by Figure
51. Several factors contribute to this trend. Bhutan’s industrial sector is heavily reliant on resource-
based industries like hydropower. Although these industries generate substantial gross output, their
limited downstream linkages do not translate into broader industrial development. As a result,
manufacturing remains underdeveloped, limiting industrial and economic diversification.
Figure 51: Industry Value Added, 1990-2022
80
As illustrated in Figure 52, Manufacturing share of value added has remained low, averaging
around 8 percent between 1990-2022, peaking at 11 percent in 1996 and has stagnated around 7-9
percent since. In contrast, the Electricity and Construction sectors maintain higher shares to value
added averaging 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Despite the large contribution of the
mining sector in terms of export, share to value added averages at 2% for the time period.
Figure 52: Growth in Industry Gross Output and Value Added, 1990 - 2022
Despite the low levels of contribution to total value added by the manufacturing and mining
sectors, the growth trend of value added indicates promising potential. Steady growth is observed
in gross output of the manufacturing sector, which contrasts the steeper and more erratic growth
of value added. Mining and quarrying show a sharper growth in gross output post-2012 and value
added by the sector mimics this growth, but growth remains concentrated in raw materials exports
rather than fostering high-value industries. A similar growth trend can be observed in the
construction sector, however erratic spikes are linked to hydropower projects, reinforcing the
sector’s dependence on infrastructure development as a key growth driver.
In contrast, the electricity sector demonstrates marginal growth in both output and value-added,
with level growth occurring only during the commissioning of new hydropower projects. This
suggests that while the sector plays a crucial role in the economy, its expansion remains tied to
project cycles rather than sustained, organic growth. Overall, while the manufacturing, mining,
and construction sectors exhibit strong growth potential, their trajectories vary in stability and key
81
driving factors. Nevertheless, although the manufacturing sector shows growth, this does not
indicate industrialization as the share of the service sector is far more significant.
6.5.3 Role of Supply Chain and Value Chain in Industrial Development
Although the government has undertaken targeted interventions to improve industrial growth and
diversification, it has not yielded the desired results. The sluggish growth of the manufacturing
sector is mainly on account of the inadequate supply and value chain linkages in the country. While
the objective of the establishment of the industrial parks was to cluster similar industries to
optimize supply and value chains, the progress in establishing these parks has been slow and
ineffective. Further, the entire network of activities, organizations and resource allocation in
producing and delivering products from raw materials to the final consumer has not been
standardized. In particular, a manufacturing unit dependent on raw material supplied domestically
faces greater cost and uncertainty of the supply chain within the country. Therefore, most
manufacturing industries are reliant on imported raw materials. As a result, there is little to no
linkages between producers within the country.
The lack of linkages between the producers has resulted in a lower value-addition in the value
chain at each stage of production within the country. Since each industry is independent of the
other, the process of converting raw materials to higher-value goods is very limited. For a
manufacturing unit to be able to convert raw materials to higher-value goods it requires sound
logistics (inbound and outbound), modern processing, advanced inventory management, and
assembly system (Porter, M., 1985). This production process needs to be supported by
technological development, infrastructure and skilled human resources (Porter, M., 1985). Lack of
value chain has resulted in direct export of raw materials and at best, very little value addition.
Further, concentration of industries in MSME can also be attributed to lack of supply chain and
value chain resulting in a weak industrial base.
Higher value-addition represents higher utilization of factors of production such as labor and
capital, thereby benefiting the economy. Value chain development at a wider level is not possible
without efficient supply chain development. It is imperative to resolve the issues of limited
infrastructure, logistic bottlenecks, and a lack of coordination among fragmented stakeholders,
especially government agencies who are key players in supply and value chain development.
Strengthening both the supply and value chain in key industries through value-based production
and marketing while developing efficient supply chains around the industry is one of the ways to
expedite the industrialization process. Additionally, it is also important that Bhutan develop an
industrial development policy focused on nurturing highly specialized industries in which Bhutan
holds a comparative advantage.
82
6.6 Conclusion
Bhutan’s industrial sector remains a critical driver of economic growth, yet it faces structural
challenges that limit its expansion and competitiveness. The sector is heavily reliant on
hydropower, mining, and small-scale manufacturing, with large enterprises dominating market
share while MSMEs struggle with high competition and scaling barriers. The analysis of market
concentration reveals varying levels of competition across industries, with small industries facing
intense competition, while capital-intensive sectors such as mining and large-scale manufacturing
exhibit higher market concentration. Despite policy interventions such as the CSI Policy 2019,
manufacturing remains underdeveloped, and Bhutan’s participation in global value chains is
insignificant due to limited value-addition in exports.
The growing reliance on the service sector and the declining contribution of manufacturing
highlights the exacerbation of premature deindustrialization, where economic growth shifts toward
services before achieving full industrial development. Bhutan’s small domestic market, high
production costs, and infrastructure gaps further constrain industrial growth. While targeted
policies have led to some diversification, particularly in agricultural value-added industries;
scaling up remains a challenge due to regulatory constraints, skill shortages, and logistical barriers.
To achieve sustainable industrialization, Bhutan must focus on production know-how,
infrastructure development, and supply and value chain while fostering a supportive business
environment for industrial growth. An industrial development policy focused on nurturing highly
specialized industries will be key to strengthening regional and global trade linkages, promoting
investment in high-value manufacturing, and addressing bottlenecks in industrial development.

Chapter 7:
State Owned Enterprises
7.1 Introduction
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) play a vital role in bridging the market gap given the current state
of the economy. With a relatively nascent private sector with significant public sector presence,
SOEs becomes an economic agent that functions under market principles yet ventures into areas
where the private sector would not. Therefore, SOEs can play a crucial role in accelerating growth
in Bhutanese economy. However, their performance is often scrutinized due to concerns about
inefficiency, bureaucratic interference, and lack of competition (OECD, 2023). The SOEs in
Bhutan, with a combined asset of Nu. 371,868.974 million in 2024, play a pivotal role in providing
essential services and infrastructure in the market.44
In advanced economies, where private sector involvement is more pronounced, the role of SOEs
has shifted towards facilitating infrastructure development and addressing market failures. While
SOEs in countries like China and Russia continue to play a dominant role, European nations, such
as the United Kingdom and Germany, have significantly reduced state ownership in favor of
privatization (World Bank, 2024). Even though SOEs play a significant role in economic
development, their impact on economic growth and overall productivity is contingent upon the
quality of a country’s institutions (Faccio & Lang, 2002).
7.2 Overview
The primary mandate of SOEs in Bhutan is to enhance productivity and accelerate economic
growth. Historically, as a result of a lack of economic agents such as entrepreneurs, industrial
manufacturers and traders in the market, the government has maintained a strong role in the
economy, particularly through SOEs in sectors such as energy, transport, and telecommunications.
Over the years, as market capabilities have improved, the government privatized some SOEs
through selling shares to the public, for example Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan Ltd,
Bhutan Tourism Corporation Ltd, and others, distributing wealth from the government to the
households. However, since 2008, while the number of SOEs has increased, the efficiency of SOEs
have not met expectations.
The MoF is the primary shareholder of all the SOEs in the country and Druk Holding and
Investments (DHI) holds a centralized ownership over its portfolio of SOEs on behalf of the Royal
Government of Bhutan with MoF owning 100 percent of shares in DHI. Most SOEs in Bhutan
were established within the past two decades. This report covers the 24 SOEs directly owned by
the MoF and DHI owned and controlled companies with a shareholding of more than 50 percent.
44 The total combined asset accounts only for SOEs with shareholding greater than 50%.

7.3 Sectoral Performance of SOEs: Trend and Outlook
7.3.1 Past Performance
The SOEs operating in the industrial, services, and primary sectors have experienced notable
developments between 2022 and 2024. In the industrial sector, the manufacturing segment showed
steady improvement, with the fixed asset turnover ratio increasing from 1.52 to 1.80, reflecting
enhanced capital utilization. However, profitability remained volatile, as the net profit ratio
fluctuated between 0.55 and 6.15 percent, indicating that structural adjustments were still ongoing.
In contrast, the mining and quarrying sector exhibited a trend towards consolidation, with its fixed
asset turnover ratio declining from 8.94 in 2022 to 8.01 in 2024. Despite this operational
adjustment, the sector maintained robust profitability, with net profit ratios consistently above 34
percent, demonstrating strong market fundamentals.
In the services sector, financial intermediation saw significant strengthening, with the net profit
ratio improving from 4.04 to 13.33 percent and the fixed asset turnover ratio increasing from 7.72
to 10.51, indicating improved operational efficiency and successful business model adaptation.
Additionally, the wholesale and retail trade sector displayed a remarkable recovery, moving from
a net loss position of 3.14 percent in 2022 to profitability of 1.66 percent by 2024, while
maintaining high asset turnover ratios. In the primary sector, agriculture showed volatile
performance, with persistent loss ranging from -20.35 to -9.18 percent. Overall, operational
metrics indicated gradual improvement, suggesting that structural reforms were beginning to take
effect.
85
7.3.2 Outlook for 2025
The manufacturing sector is expected to improve, with a fixed asset turnover ratio of 2.11 and a
stabilized net profit ratio of 5.64 percent, reflecting improved capital efficiency. In mining and
quarrying, a slight decrease in fixed asset turnover to 7.30 is anticipated, but strong profitability
of 32.70 percent is expected to persist. In services, financial intermediation will experience
consolidation, with profitability strengthening to 17.08 percent despite a moderation in fixed asset
turnover to 6.35, while the wholesale and retail trade sector maintains its recovery with a projected
net profit ratio of 1.17 percent. The primary sector, particularly agriculture, is poised for a
breakthrough with a positive net profit ratio of 1.63 percent and improved fixed asset turnover to
2.13, indicating progress made through improved corporate governance and business process re-
engineering. Enhanced productivity metrics further suggest operational efficiency gains in the
sector.

However, across industries, the labor’s share to gross profit is either declining or remains fairly
stable at low levels. This indicates that much of the output is being value added as a result of capital
injection or capital-intensive activities. As can be seen in Chapter 8, the capital productivity in the
economy has been declining at the rate of 3.4 percent, as a result, SOEs’ productivity in the
economy is also declining. For Bhutan’s economy to be productive the SOEs’ labor’s share of
gross profit has to be at least 70 percent. Unlike the private sectors, the primary mandate of SOEs
is to enhance productivity and accelerate economic growth. While there has been notable progress,
there is still potential for improvement and growth.
7.4 Leverage Risks and Counter-cyclical Investments in SOEs
SOEs in Bhutan, particularly those involved in large infrastructure projects like hydropower, face
significant leverage risks and contingent liabilities, which can be a source of macroeconomic
volatility. Many of these enterprises are highly leveraged, relying on substantial debt financing,
and the government bears the risk if projects fail to meet expected returns. This fiscal exposure
could undermine long-term economic growth and fiscal sustainability. Reducing debt levels and
improving the operational efficiency of SOEs are key to mitigating these risks, potentially reducing
the government’s fiscal burden and improving investor confidence.
In parallel, counter-cyclical investments, particularly in supply and value chain development, play
a crucial role in stabilizing Bhutan’s economy during periods of downturn. These investments,
which align with the country’s Gross National Happiness (GNH) framework, not only stimulates
economic growth but also enhance social well-being and environmental sustainability. Well-
managed SOEs, especially in supply chain and value chain development, and energy, are essential
for ensuring that counter-cyclical investments are effective, generating sustainable returns while
fostering long-term economic stability.
87
7.5 Conclusion
SOEs play a crucial role in Bhutan’s economy to boost productivity and accelerate economic
growth by bridging market gaps. However, despite their significance, concerns about low-
productivity, bureaucratic interference and weak competition persists. While some SOEs have
improved profitability and operational efficiency in recent years, many remain underperforming,
particularly in the primary sector. Addressing these inefficiencies through corporate governance
reforms and productivity enhancement is essential for ensuring their long-term sustainability and
contributing meaningfully to the economy rather than functioning like a government agency.
The sectoral performance of SOEs highlights mixed trends, with notable improvements in financial
intermediation and manufacturing, while agriculture and some service sectors continue to
underperform. Another concern is the low labor share in gross profit indicating capital-intensive
operations, raising concerns about declining productivity and inefficient resource allocation. To
sustain economic growth, SOEs must prioritize better workforce engagement, high-value addition,
and efficient capital utilization; aligning their objective with broader national economic goals.
Managing leverage risks and enhancing counter-cyclical investments are also key in ensuring
SOEs’ financial sustainability and resilience. High debt levels pose fiscal risks that require
strategic interventions to minimize government liabilities. Counter-cyclical investments in supply
and value chain development, and energy can mitigate economic downturns while aligning with
Bhutan’s GNH principles. Developing upstream and downstream networks of subcontractors to
develop the entire industry and engaging the private sector should be prioritized. Strengthening
governance, improving efficiency, reducing dependency on government for capital injections and
subsidies, and fostering innovation will be critical to maximizing SOEs’ contribution to national
goals.
88
Chapter 8:
Sources of Economic Growth: Productivity
8.1 Introduction
Growth accounting framework/productivity account decomposes sources of economic growth into
contributions from labor, capital and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). This framework quantifies
the extent to which output growth stems from two factors of production - capital and labor inputs.
When these factors are used efficiently, the economy accumulates a certain degree of technical
efficiency commonly referred to as the TFP or Solow residual. It captures the efficiency gains that
are critical for sustaining long-run growth. Bhutan’s industry-level productivity account database
(1990-2022) provides insights into the sources of growth to understand the productivity dynamics
to identify growth drivers and areas requiring intervention for enhanced economic performance.46
Investigating the sources of Bhutanese growth reveal a stagnating TFP over the past 3 decades
which stems from a unique dynamic of gradual increase in labor productivity and declining capital
productivity. The economic growth, largely driven by hydropower development, is characterized
by a high level of investment ratio, with capital input growth exceeding the output growth.
Consequently, the growth model is driven by high levels of capital accumulation rather than capital
assimilation. This is evident in declining capital productivity across all sectors except the finance
and insurance implying the inefficiency in capital resource utilization. On the other hand, while
most of the sectors exhibit increasing labor productivity, this growth is contributed by capital
deepening, whereby each worker has more capital to work with, rather than the TFP improvements
which signifies the lack of capital assimilation.
The TFP growth, a measure of efficiency gains, is critical for long-term sustainable growth but the
lack of it highlights the structural weakness in Bhutanese economy. This is of further concern,
particularly when Bhutan's TFP growth is the lowest among its regional peers and showing a
diverging trend with that of India’s, implying that Bhutan is being outcompeted. Therefore, this
diagnosis from a growth accounting perspective calls for a prudence in investment and optimal
utilization of the factors of production, particularly in the 13th FYP and going forward towards a
productivity-led growth to achieve the objective of a high-income country.
46 In 2024, Bhutan’s productivity account database was developed, with a focus on industry-level productivity from 1990-2022
(Building upon the work done in 2016). The DMDF, Ministry of Finance in collaboration with Professor Koji Nomura of Keio
University with support of Joint SDG-Fund of the UNDP constructed a comprehensive productivity account to evaluate Bhutan’s
growth dynamics. This involved developing a detailed industry-level account that measured the contributions of labor, capital, and
TFP. A detailed time-series database on QALI, investment and capital stock database was developed to enable this analysis in
absence of data unavailability.
89
8.2 Growth Drivers
Bhutan’s economy has a long-run average growth rate of about 7-8 percent per annum. Of the
three main drivers of economic growth, the Average Labor Productivity (ALP) has been growing
at 5 percent on average between 1990-2022. However, both Average Capital Productivity (AKP)
and TFP growth declined over the same period as shown in Figure 54. In particular, AKP has been
declining at 3.4 percent on average. This decline in AKP due to capital intensive growth
overshadowed the growth in ALP, resulting in TFP stagnation. It can be seen that Bhutan’s long
term economic growth rate has dropped to 4-5 percent during the period 2008-2023. The TFP
growth in Bhutan stagnated between 1990-2022, declining at 0.7 percent annually, suggesting that
Bhutan’s capital-intensive driven growth has not translated into TFP improvements.
Figure 54: Aggregate Productivities, 1990-2022
Similar trends are observed when investigating the sources of growth across different sectors
within the economy, as illustrated in Figure 55. It can be observed that the ALP has been increasing
between 1990-2022 for all sectors except for the hotel and restaurant. The hotels and restaurants,
closely associated with tourism, have a high level of oscillations in ALP and AKP relative to other
sectors as a result of the capital cycle. Despite the oscillations, there was an upward trend in capital
and labor productivity until around 2008 which highlights the returns to early adopters in the
tourism industry. However, post-2008s, there were new hotels being built without proportional
increase in tourists arrivals leading to the decline in both capital and labor productivity.
Mining and quarrying, and wholesale and retail trade where most of the labor movement from the
agriculture sector happens, has one of the highest ALP growth among the different sectors. The
agriculture sector, despite the significant importance accorded by the government as the largest
employer in the economy, still struggles with one of the lowest labor productivity growth at 2.64
percent on average.
Unlike the ALP, the TFP and AKP have consistently declined in most sectors. The TFP growth
lies between -2.4 and 0.8 percent while the AKP growth lies between -5.3 and 0.5 percent on
90
average. As Bhutan’s economy has been largely driven by capital accumulation, more capital
investment into the economy with inefficient allocation of resources has resulted in decline in the
capital productivity over the period. Further, this has led to the stagnation of TFP despite the
gradual increase in labor productivity.

8.3 Labor Productivity
Labor productivity growth is defined as the amount of real production (GDP) per hour worked.
Labor productivity grew at 5 percent annually between 1990-2022. Within an economy, labor
productivity mainly grows due to 3 main factors - human capital accumulation, economies of scale
and technological factors.
Table 14: Labor Productivity Growth by Sector47
In the electricity sector, labor productivity grew at 4.01 percent annually on average between 1990
and 2022. In the non-electricity sector, as illustrated in Table 14, the strongest labor productivity
growth was observed in real estate (4.93 percent), wholesale and retail trade (4.75 percent) and
mining and quarrying (3.48 percent). On the other hand, decline in labor productivity on average
was only observed in hotels and restaurants (-1.68 percent) which was further exacerbated by the
pandemic which observed a decline of -27.87 after 2020. The public sector labor productivity has
also been consistently low due to the fact that the public sector, in general, does not produce any
tradable goods and services, while it remains one of the largest employers in the economy with 18
percent share of market employment.
Decomposing the sources of labor productivity growth reveal that the labor productivity is mainly
driven by capital deepening across all sectors, while labor quality’s contribution is positive but
remains small and TFP’s contribution is limited. The capital deepening driven ALP growth implies
that there is more accumulated capital that each labor can use. The limited contribution from TFP
growth highlights that the labor productivity is driven more by capital accumulation than capital
assimilation - “the ability to effectively integrate and utilize new capital within the existing
production” (Nomura, 2024, p.169).
The industry level analysis shows that the labor productivity growth in mining and quarrying,
electricity, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate is mainly a result of capital deepening. During
47 The industry-level ALP is defined as constant-price gross output per hour worked
92
the period 2008-2019, the labor productivity growth in the wholesale and retail trade,
transportation and communication and private, social and recreational services was bolstered by
TFP growth, as shown in Figure 56. The labor productivity growth in the public sector is
consistently driven by labor quality as it is one of the few sectors that can absorb a highly educated
workforce within the Bhutanese economy.
Figure 56: Sources of labor productivity growth by industry
Further, an analysis of the labor market dynamics through the quality-adjusted labor input database
across industries reveals that Bhutan’s labor share to GDP declined from close to 60 percent in
1990 to a low of 33.30 percent in 2007 before rising 49.30 percent in 2022.48 Moreover, Bhutan’s
labor market share remains below that of India of more than 60 percent in 2022. This indicates the
capital-intensive nature of Bhutan’s economy, such as the hydropower sector where employment
has been stagnant around 4,000, limiting the contribution of labor. This raises concern in terms of
sluggish income growth and lower share of income.
Additionally, the growth in total hours worked showed a modest growth of 1.14 percent as a result
of increased number of employment (1.51 percent) while average hours worked decreased by 0.37
percent between 1990-2022. There is also an increase in the labor quality improvement rate from
1.61 percent between 1990-2008 to 2.99 percent in 2008-2022 where educational attainment was
the primary driver. This highlights the important role of education in improving labor productivity
and human capital accumulation.
48 A comprehensive quality-adjusted labor input data for Bhutan, 1990-2022 was developed as part of the Bhutan productivity
account in absences of time-series estimates for compensation of employees in the national accounts.
93
Figure 57: Labor Market Dynamics, 1990-2022
Overall, the labor productivity growth across most sectors is driven by increased capital investment
rather than efficiency gains. Therefore, while capital investment is increasing, the effectiveness in
driving long-run productivity growth may be limited. Additionally, the labor share of GDP remains
relatively low compared to India, which could have implications for income growth and overall
economic inclusivity.
8.4 Capital Productivity
Improvement in capital productivity for Bhutan has been a challenge which has been declining at
3.4 percent annually between 1990-2022. Historically, Bhutan’s economic growth has mainly been
driven by capital accumulation. With more investment into capital without the efficient allocation
of resources and lack of capital assimilation, the resulting impact is the decline in capital
productivity. During the same period, the capital input growth of 9.5 percent exceeded the output
growth of 6.2 percent. Capital accumulation accounted for 5.4 percentage points of this growth,
representing 88 percent of the total economic growth.
The decline in AKP also stems from high Capital Output Ratio (COR). The investment and capital
stock matrices estimate Bhutan’s nominal capital stock at Nu. 16,313.517 million in 1990, Nu.
59,617.224 million in 2001 and Nu. 904,897.953 million in 2022 as detailed in Annexure IV.49
The nominal capital stock in 2022 is equivalent to four times the GDP at current prices resulting
in a COR of 4:1, a rise from 3.1 in 1990 and 3.8 in 2007. This implies that 4 units of capital
investment is required to generate an output of 1 unit. This ratio is higher than that of other South
Asian countries. For instance, Sri Lanka’s COR stood at 3.6, Nepal’s at 3.2, Bangladesh’s at 2.4,
and Pakistan’s at 1.5 (Nomura, 2024). Bhutan’s relatively high COR reflects increased
49 A comprehensive capital stock account was developed in absence of it in Bhutan’s System of National Accounts.
94
inefficiencies in resource allocation and low capital productivity, suggesting that public-sector
driven investments in Bhutan are not being optimally utilized.
Figure 58: Share of Capital Stock by Sector
Over the past three decades, there is a decreasing trend in the agriculture sector’s share of the total
capital stock and an increasing trend in the electricity sector’s share. This highlights the shift from
low to high productivity sector but the structural transformation has not resulted in increase in
productivity as illustrated by Table 15 showing the decline in capital productivity across various
sectors of the economy.
Table 15: Capital Productivity Growth by Sectors50
Capital productivity declined in all sectors in the economy, except for finance and insurance.
Finance and insurance is the only sector where a modest AKP growth of 0.52 percent was observed
50 Industry-level AKP is defined as real gross output per capital service
95
between 1990 to 2022. The highest decline in capital productivity is seen in hotels and restaurants,
private and recreational services, construction and manufacturing by 5.29 percent, 5.23 percent,
4.94 percent and 4.63 percent, respectively. A look at capital productivity in the manufacturing
sector shows a decline of 4.63 percent between 1990-2022, with a faster rate of decline observed
post-2008. This is of concern as manufacturing has the highest growth potential for productive
spillover considering its forward and backward linkages with other sectors. The overall decline in
AKP observed across sectors, shows a diminishing return to capital, with additional capital
investment leading to a decline in the capital productivity. Only efficient utilization of all factors
of production using optimal input combination will be able to generate growth driving investments.
Despite the electricity sector being the main driver of the economy, it has experienced a decline in
capital productivity of 1.56 percent on average. In recent times, this is due to large investments in
hydropower projects, which has been exacerbated by cost escalations and completion delays
without proportionate increase in returns. The revenue generation is constrained by installed
generation limits and export prices that are not market driven (while the operation cost is at market
rate), which are determined through bilateral agreements and revisited only periodically. This has
resulted in decline in capital productivity on average, with a notable sharp decline observed
between 2000 and 2020. On the other hand, the sector being capital-intensive, has seen a relatively
high labor productivity growth of 4.01 percent on average. Consequently, the TFP growth has
declined by 1.48 percent.
Going forward, resource allocation within the economy must be carefully planned. Capital
investments that do not enhance domestic production capacity will further reduce capital
productivity, ultimately hindering economic progress. Such prudence in investment should be
made, particularly, for the government investment projects.
8.5 Total Factor Productivity
TFP, typically calculated as a ratio of aggregate output to aggregate input, measures the efficiency
in the economy. TFP growth, estimated as a residual, is output growth that is not explained by
growth in labor and capital inputs. Its growth implies efficiency gains in the economy and
improved resource allocation, while stagnation signifies inefficiencies/reliance on input-driven
growth.
Industry level analysis of TFP contributions reveals stagnation in both the electricity and non-
electricity sector. Agriculture is one of the only sectors, whose growth in recent times has seen a
growth in TFP, which can be attributed to the introduction of improved seed varieties and farming
techniques. Few sectors – manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, finance and insurance and
private, social and recreational services – have observed positive TFP growth over the period, but
have seen a decline in TFP in the recent years, particularly from 2009. The manufacturing sector
on average has observed a modest growth of 0.20 on average, but it has seen a decline in TFP of
0.50 percent on average since 2009 compared to a positive albeit small growth of 0.75 percent
96
during 1990-2008. Similarly, the wholesale and retail trade observed a decline in the TFP growth
of 2.39 percent during the pandemic (2020-2022).
Table 16: TFP growth by sectors
The electricity sector’s TFP growth has been close to 5 percent between 2020-2022, but has
suffered a major decline in its TFP between 2000-2019 averaging 3.57 percent. The construction
sector also exhibits a similar trend with TFP improvements observed between 2020-2022 (1.02
percent) but had negative TFP growth historically, with a -1.95 percent growth observed between
2000-2019. These sectors have the ability to boost labor productivity and offer higher quality
employment. Nevertheless, as a result of decline in the TFP, the quality of growth in this sector is
declining, raising concerns about its ability to drive economic growth.
Figure 59: TFP in South Asian Economies
Source: Nomura (2024)
97
The declining TFP growth in Bhutan is even more of a concern when compared to that of the
neighbors. Regional comparison highlights that Bhutan has the lowest TFP compared to its South
Asian counterparts, particularly post-2005, as illustrated in Figure 59. Even more alarming is the
widening gap between Bhutan and India, with Bhutan’s productivity behind by 2.7 percentage
points annually between 1990-2022. This productivity gap raises concern about Bhutan’s
competitiveness, especially given Bhutan’s close economic ties with India including the pegged
exchange rate and as its primary trading partner. The widening TFP gap with India suggests
potential challenges for Bhutan’s manufacturing and agriculture sectors in global markets. To
sustain long-term economic growth and competitiveness, it is critical for Bhutan to close this
productivity gap, focusing on improving capital efficiencies across all sectors.
8.6 Conclusion
Over the past three decades, Bhutan has experienced a decline in capital productivity and stagnant
TFP growth, while the labor productivity increased gradually. The growth accounting framework
reveals critical insights into the sources of economic growth for Bhutan, suggesting that while
labor productivity has shown consistent improvements, the capital-intensive driven growth has
crossed its limits. The decline in capital productivity and stagnant TFP, particularly in sectors such
as construction, electricity, hotels and restaurants, reflects the challenges of inefficient capital
allocation calling the need for more strategic investments. The rise of COR over time, further
highlights the inefficiencies in investments.
Manufacturing and other tradable sectors, which are crucial for Bhutan’s economic diversification
from hydropower-led growth, face declining capital productivity. Further analysis of the RER
between India and Bhutan reveals that Bhutan is becoming less competitive. Combining this factor
with lower productivity as compared to the neighboring countries, it reduces Bhutan’s export
competitiveness. This is a worrying trend because Bhutan has historically been dependent on
imports, while at the same time the youth unemployment has remained consistently high due to
the lack of these sectors' ability to generate employment.
To ensure long-term sustainable and competitive economic growth, Bhutan must shift its focus
from capital-intensive driven growth to improving capital allocation and efficient utilization to
foster productivity-driven growth. This requires strategic resource allocation, a more vibrant and
dynamic financial market, better public investment management and domestic market
deregulation. Addressing these structural challenges will be critical for Bhutan to enhance its
competitiveness, economic sustainability and support the development of GMC.

Chapter 9:
Challenges and Opportunities: A Double-Edged
Economic Frontier
9.1 Introduction
Over the last few decades, Bhutan has made significant strides in economic development and social
progress. This is evident in the enhanced access to education and healthcare, increase in life
expectancy, poverty reduction, infrastructure development, and the transition to a successful
constitutional democratic monarchy. The recent graduation from Least Developed Countries
(LDC) in 2023 reinforces these achievements. Despite such progress, Bhutan’s economy is still
grappling with several critical macroeconomic and social challenges that must be addressed to
secure a sustainable development path.
While the country has experienced rapid growth, this has not translated into substantial
improvements in household income or overall economic conditions. The per capita GDP remains
at only US$ 3,919, one-third of the global average, highlighting the disconnect between growth
and real economic benefit for households. A key factor behind this disparity is the lack of economic
diversification beyond the hydropower sector, which does not generate sufficient employment
opportunities for an expanding workforce and contribute to productivity gains. As such this has
resulted in the recent trend of exodus among skilled professionals and the productive youth, who
would have contributed to the economic development.
The government’s fiscal position remains highly vulnerable, with persistent fiscal deficits, as much
of the capital investment is financed through external grants and borrowings. Furthermore, the
country’s reliance on exporting raw renewable energy, without any value-addition due to a lack of
industrial development and production know-how, has led to domestic supply constraints and a
growing trade deficit. Private sector credit is heavily concentrated in a few sectors, such as housing
and tradable services, which has increased imports and placed additional pressure on foreign
exchange reserves. These factors collectively hinder the realization of more substantial economic
growth and improvements in household well-being, contributing to the ongoing challenges in
Bhutan’s development.
As the nation aspires to achieve “high-income GNH economy” status by 2034, there is a need to
pursue policy reforms and interventions aimed at fostering economic diversification, industrial
development, public sector reforms, deregulations and private sector development.
99
9.2 Challenges
9.2.1 Capital-intensive growth model
The current assessment suggests that the economy is growing below its potential level and
historical averages, reflecting room for further growth opportunities. A persistent negative output
gap suggests that labor and capital are not being employed at optimal levels, with high
unemployment and lower productivity. While much of this is attributed to the weak aggregate
demand and sluggish investment post-pandemic, it is closely linked to the lack of economic
diversification, inefficient allocation and utilization of resources while relying significantly on
hydropower and tourism sectors. This is evident from the growth estimates doubling in 2025 from
2024 with the commissioning of the PHP-II.
While it is important to continue to develop the hydropower sector as a foundation of the economy,
it is also essential that economic diversification is given priority. Dependency on hydropower-led
growth models is a concern, especially at a time when the impact of climate-change is felt quickly.
As the Himalayan glaciers erode rapidly, Bhutan’s development model of relying singularly on
hydropower is unsustainable. The continued reliance on government-led investments has not
yielded the required diversification in the economy. Moreover, the continued interventions of
government agencies, not just as financiers but also as producers in the market along with various
regulations have led to a weak private sector. Reforms are also necessary in the private sector,
alongside a shift from rent-seeking behavior that depends on public resources to sustain their
operations. This calls for change in the business process of government agencies to move away
from the market as a producer and regulator to a more productive role as facilitator to boost the
domestic economy through private sector-led growth.
9.2.2 Structural twin deficit
The persistent fiscal deficit combined with CAD represents a structural challenge for Bhutan.
Irrespective of the economic circumstances, the fiscal policy has been consistently expansionary
rather than counter-cyclical. As a small developing economy, Bhutan's economy heavily relies on
government expenditure. Given such a high level of spending, the effectiveness of that spending
is a primary concern. Excluding hydropower, the widening trade deficit indicates that government
spending has not led to increased production or productivity but has instead fueled consumption.
This imbalance contributes to the ongoing CAD.
The continued expansionary fiscal policy has led to a rising fiscal deficit, accompanied by growing
debt servicing costs. The growth in expenditure continues to outpace income, leading to a
heightened reliance on external grants for deficit financing. Additionally, much of the capital
expenditure in recent years has been marked by underutilization, resulting in sunk costs, as
reflected in a low fiscal multiplier. Poor expenditure planning has further exacerbated the issue,
with capital utilization reaching only 16.75 percent of the revised estimates for FY 2024/25, as of
100
31st December. This low utilization will likely lead to last-minute procurement towards the end of
the FY, compromising the quality of infrastructure projects and procurement.
9.2.3 High interest rate spread and NPL
The financial market in Bhutan is confronted with various challenges primarily rooted in limited
monetary policy autonomy as a result of a pegged exchange rate regime. The limited monetary
autonomy has weakened the transmission of monetary policy, rendering the MLR ineffective in
influencing market interest rates. Due to this, the interest rate spread between the deposit and
lending rate has been one of the highest in the region. The high interest rate spread makes it
difficult for entrepreneurs to access credit despite the government’s continued interventions to
improve credit access. Nevertheless, a host of government interventions create moral hazard
combined with a small domestic market resulting in entrepreneurs defaulting on the loan.
A high interest rate spread also indicates inefficiencies in the banking sector, leading to increased
financial sector instability. Further, Bhutan’s economy has been growing at an average rate of 4-5
percent since 2008, mainly driven by hydropower. In line with the economic growth rate,
entrepreneurs expect similar returns on investments, however, given the high level of competition
in the market along with limited opportunities for expansion and narrow economic base,
entrepreneurs are unable to pay-off their loans. This, ultimately, has resulted in high NPL. Further,
in sectors with high return, the capital cycle dampens the investment resulting in NPL, which is
evident from high NPL in the housing and tourism sector. Higher the NPL, the more risk-averse
the banks become, resulting in higher interest rates. High interest rate spread coupled with high
NPL and continued loan deferment could cause systemic risks. While the government through ESP
provided reinvigoration funds mainly to reduce the risks, the loan disbursement rate by the banks
has been slow.
9.2.4 Massive investments could cause excess liquidity
A challenge in the monetary and financial sector is the increase in liquidity in the market, expected
as a result of 13th FYP and ESP implementation gaining momentum along with increase in
hydropower and other investments. As the supply-side adjustment takes time to meet the rising
demand, there potentially could be excessive liquidity. As a result, the increased demand, causing
an increase in imports could result in drainage of reserves as previously observed in 2012-2013.
Under such circumstances, administrative measures such as moratorium have been used due to the
ineffectiveness of monetary policy tools. This results in the contraction of the economy, undoing
the growth progress made through expansionary fiscal policy. Therefore, it is important to
implement effective liquidity management and other tools that could sweep liquidity out of the
market, without having to resort to administrative measures.
101
9.2.5 Persistent external imbalance - the main source of vulnerabilities
The major macroeconomic shock stems from the external imbalance. In the past 2 decades,
external imbalance caused about 3 episodes of macroeconomic shocks during which,
administrative measures were implemented. Still, Bhutan continues to face a high CAD, about
11.81 percent of GDP in FY 2024/25, primarily due to supply-side weaknesses. The weak supply-
side makes the economy dependent on imports with a narrow export base mainly constituting
electricity and low value-added raw materials exports. As a result, the trade deficit has been
growing, especially with India. Further, the overvaluation of the ngultrum worsens
competitiveness with India. With imports from India projected to rise, particularly due to new
hydropower development, Bhutan’s trade position will further worsen.
The persistent structural CAD has been financed through external grants and borrowings. The twin
deficits – fiscal and current – financed through external sources, especially external borrowings is
a concern as both public and private sectors are living beyond their productive capacity. With
sluggish economic growth, the inefficient resource allocation continues to be financed through the
twin deficits, which is a concerning trend. In this regard, FDI can play a crucial role by bringing
in production know-how, technology and productivity. However, FDI inflows remain weak and
are concentrated in well-established sectors like tourism, rather than emerging industries such as
manufacturing and agriculture. Regulatory hurdles, bureaucratic inefficiencies and capital controls
continue to restrict investment opportunities for both domestic and FDI companies, making it
difficult to achieve the 13th FYP’s ambitious FDI target of Nu. 500 billion.
9.2.6 Bhutan’s labor market inefficiencies: From agriculture to brain drain
Bhutan’s labor market is heavily reliant on the agricultural sector with about 41 percent of the total
employment. While the economy has been transitioning from agriculture to industry and services,
the labor market has not kept pace. The agriculture contribution to GDP has declined by almost 50
percent since the 1980s, to about 15 percent. This has resulted in under-employment and
productivity stagnation in agriculture. Furthermore, a growing threat from wildlife and rapidly-
evolving impact of climate change poses a threat to sustainability of agricultural practices, and
thus, the rural economy.
While the industry and service sectors have been absorbing the labor moving away from
agriculture, it has not been able to generate adequate jobs due to the narrow base and low
manufacturing productivity and capital cycle in the tourism sector. The public sector has been one
of the sectors absorbing labor but it does not produce goods and services that are tradable in the
market by adding value, therefore it cannot absorb labor without straining the fiscal sustainability.
On the other hand, the private sector has been weak and reliant on government handouts. As a
result of the lack of industry that provides gainful employment, youth unemployment has been
persistent. This has various consequences, one of which is the brain drain whereby skilled workers
are seeking jobs abroad. Essentially, if such a trend continues, Bhutan will become a factor of
102
producing highly educated youths whose benefits are being reaped by other nations with greater
productivity.
9.2.7 Premature deindustrialization
With an economic growth centered around hydropower and tourism, the economy faces substantial
risks especially at the face of weak industrial growth in manufacturing. Premature
deindustrialization has become an urgent concern as the economy is shifting from agriculture to
services, without the proper development of the manufacturing sector. This lack of industrial
growth and diversification, combined with an overreliance on a few sectors limits the economy’s
capacity to absorb the labor force effectively. Additionally, the absence of a robust manufacturing
sector hampers the economy’s ability to produce value-added goods, thereby limiting avenues to
bolster the supply-side and build industrial resilience.
Without the capacity to produce goods domestically, the economy remains highly dependent on
imports and in a vicious cycle where manufacturing capacity is weakened, limiting the economy’s
overall competitiveness. Moreover, the fragmentation of the industrial base and small domestic
market leaves little room for scaling up and economies of scale. Similarly, the lack of a coordinated
and well-established supply chain, and weak value chain linkages hinders the organic development
of industries. Thus, the culmination of these factors exacerbates the declining share of
manufacturing, thereby pushing Bhutan to deindustrialize prematurely.
9.2.8 Struggling SOEs: Inefficiency and government dependence
SOE’s were established mainly to bridge the market failure in Bhutan, particularly on account of
supporting market integration, logistics development, supply and value chain, and improving
overall productivity. However, many SOEs have suffered from low productivity and weak
competition, reducing their overall contribution to economic growth. Rather than contributing
meaningfully as intended, most SOEs are reliant on the government for financial support including
their operations. Particularly, the labor share to gross profit remains below 50 percent, while most
of the growth is driven by capital injection, thereby signifying their inefficiencies and
ineffectiveness. Since 2023, SOEs have gone under major review due to their weak financial
position and lack of contribution to the economy. While there are noticeable improvements, as the
commercial arm of the government, most are still performing below expectations.
9.2.9 Stagnant TFP due to inefficient capital allocation and utilization
Bhutan’s growth dynamics highlight a key structural challenge of a capital-intensive growth that
is not efficient. A gradual growth in labor productivity but a decline in capital productivity has
resulted in stagnant TFP. Capital productivity has declined consistently across all sectors, leading
to stagnation in TFP, indicating that resources are allocated inefficiently and are not optimally
utilized. These raise concerns on the effectiveness of public sector driven investment and the need
103
for prudence going forward. On other hand, while labor productivity growth has been observed, it
has been mainly driven by capital available per worker (economies of scale) rather than capital
assimilation as the contribution from TFP remains limited. The labor share of GDP remains low
at close to 50 percent, as compared to India (60 percent) while the long-term labor contribution to
GDP should be about 70 percent as per the literature. These have resulted in the stagnation of TFP.
As a result, the gap between Bhutan and the neighboring countries’ TFP has been growing,
particularly a diverging trend with India’s TFP, thus, Bhutan is being outcompeted.
Bhutan is situated in a region where most of the nations and its citizens are producing similar
products, which compete against each other, especially the agriculture and livestock products. Yet,
the productivity level of our neighbors is higher than that of Bhutan, making us uncompetitive.
Thus, it is essential to improve productivity through targeted interventions, effective allocation of
resources and efficient utilization of capital investments.
9.3 Opportunities
9.3.1 Leveraging South Asian economic expansion
The development of GMC reflects His Majesty’s pioneering vision and bold move towards
creating an economic hub that will serve as an investment gateway connecting South Asian and
South East Asian regions. It will enhance regional connectivity, trade and integration. The GMC
is designed to blend modern infrastructure with traditional values to harmonize mental well-being,
sustainable living, technology, knowledge and innovation.
Every Bhutanese, both home and abroad, sees GMC as a beacon of hope for Bhutan's economic
future. His Majesty has highlighted three priority areas: Energy, Connectivity, and Skills; which
every Bhutanese must embody in their thought and action for the successful development of the
GMC. The government as an economic agent must strive towards realizing the nation’s energy
capability and enhance connectivity infrastructure, through prudent investment and adoption of
digital technology.
South Asian economies are expected to expand at 6.2 percent in 2025, mainly driven by India’s
increasing share in the global economy and its emerging role in the global trade network. This
provides Bhutan access to a growing middle-income population and a diverse market, given its
Free Trade Agreement with India. Thus, providing opportunities for businesses operating in
Bhutan to leverage on Indian and other South Asian markets expansion. Therefore, Bhutanese, as
an individual, must seek to acquire 21st century job skills to compete at the global scale. A market-
ready skilled workforce is essential to attract investment in the GMC and the rest of the country.
9.3.2 Fiscal reforms for long-term sustainability
The ongoing fiscal reforms and pending implementation of the GST will broaden the tax base and
enhance efficiency in tax administration by subsuming multiple tax rates into a single rate. Further,
104
it will lower production cost by removing the cascading effect through input tax credit. This will
improve the ease of doing business with a simplified tax structure and improve efficiencies leading
to higher revenue as compared to the current regime. As a result, the revenue stream is expected
to shift from a dependency on seasonal income tax to regular consumption-based tax to finance
public expenditure, improving the government cash-flow.
Additionally, reforms in income tax are becoming increasingly relevant in light of shifting
demographic trends. With changing population dynamics, it may be important to consider reforms
that eases the tax burden and enhance overall competitiveness. Prioritizing measures that support
both businesses and individuals could be beneficial.
9.3.3 Unlocking the financial market potential
The financial market plays a very important role in fostering the development of a country.
Throughout history, most industrialized countries – Singapore, Japan, Hongkong, Switzerland,
US, and UK – have relied on strong financial markets to support their developmental efforts. In
Bhutan, the financial market is dominated by banking industries with very limited instruments.
There is an opportunity to address the high interest spreads and NPLs through policy and
institutional reforms. Interventions can come through the development of an Asset Management
Company (AMC), commodity market and diversification of the capital market.
An AMC is established as an entity to manage and enhance recoveries of distressed assets removed
from the financial system. It can either be tasked with resolving failed FIs and liquidating their
assets, or as an entity that purchases assets from performing FIs. In the second case, the assets
purchased from banks must meet certain criteria defined by the legislation or AMC. Usually, the
AMC issues government guaranteed bonds to pay for purchase. In a number of countries, AMCs
have been a part of the crisis resolution framework either as a bank resolution entity (to restructure,
sell and liquidate failed banks) or as an entity purchasing NPLs in exchange for securities.
Furthermore, with the AMC, banks could still recover a portion of their money on the NPL or ideal
assets, and as a result, it will help reduce the lending rate at a more appropriate level.
9.3.4 Enhancing global competitiveness
Bhutan could leverage its proximity to India, who is emerging as a major global player, and
enhance export diversification, while the increased inward remittances can continue to play an
important role as a source of external financing and foreign reserves. Moreover, given the low
level of FDI inflows, there is an untapped potential in FDI across various sectors. Consequently,
the FDI inflows could facilitate knowledge transfer and productivity improvements given the
declining capital productivity and premature deindustrialization observed in the Bhutanese
economy.
In this regard, there is an opportunity to attract FDI through deregulation, easing capital control
and removing bureaucratic red tape. Further, to keep the level playing field the same for FDI and
105
domestic industries, it is important to eliminate fiscal incentives. Rather, focus should be on
creating a business-friendly tax regime and other regulations to reduce the compliance cost. This
entails making income tax and other taxes, and immigration policies globally competitive
especially with those economies – Singapore, Maldives and Switzerland – with similar
characteristics to Bhutan. Additionally, the cross-border labor and capital mobility infrastructure
should also be improved.
9.3.5 Improving labor productivity for inclusive growth
Bhutan, through its education program, has a highly educated workforce. As the nation aspires to
attain a high-income economy in the next decade, a broader structural transformation is anticipated
towards more dynamic and growth oriented-sectors. A readily available workforce, with
appropriate upskilling, can be employed in more productive sectors to address existing labor
market inefficiencies. However, the success of such transition hinges on the private sector’s role
in diversification to lead the growth, and accommodative regulatory environment.
Additionally, privatizing government-financed and produced market-related goods and services
along with other market-driven interventions, can create opportunities to boost the private sector
and therefore, enhance productivity. Market-conforming interventions such as the price guarantee
scheme under the ESP is expected to boost agricultural production while lowering the price for
consumers. Other programs to develop the arts and craft industries, developing tourism products,
integrated roadside stations and entrepreneurial development programs are expected to create a
conducive environment for the private sector to thrive, facilitated by deregulation. These
interventions will collectively boost labor productivity and stimulate private sector growth.
9.3.6 Industrial development policy
Although Bhutan has been prematurely deindustrializing since 1996, the economy still has
significant potential to rebound. This demands a critical re-evaluation of past development
strategies and a renewed commitment to strategic intervention. The sector possesses resilience and
thus, presents an opportunity to reverse this trend through the formulation and adoption of a
dynamic industrial development policy. A proactive approach is required to shift from stifling
regulations and general support measures to a targeted focus on developing specialized, high-value
industries. A well-designed policy would target key sectors, fostering an enabling environment
that builds and strengthens backward and forward linkages within the supply and value chain.
It is important to align the country’s strengths with targeted interventions to create an industrial
ecosystem capable of driving sustainable growth and reducing dependency on hydropower and
tourism. Additionally, leveraging private industry participation would be key to incentivize local
firms to invest, scale and compete. Targeted interventions in 13th FYP to improve binding logistic
and infrastructural constraints would complement industrial development through lowered
production costs. Further, Bhutan’s growing pool of skilled labor, bolstered by programs such as
Gyalsung and De-suung, offers a strong foundation for reinvigorating the manufacturing sector
106
while addressing the persistently high level of youth unemployment. Thus, an industrial
development policy would be able to foster targeted growth in key industries – such as foodtech,
biotech, health and wellness, IT and high-skill services – through the development of supply and
value chains, production know-how and infrastructure, addressing the logistical constraints and
creating an enabling environment with targeted interventions.
9.3.7 SOE as the growth accelerator through kaizen implementation
Since the review of SOEs began, their profitability and operational efficiency have improved
significantly. Notably, SOEs in finance and manufacturing have demonstrated higher profitability
and better capital utilization. Given their strong upstream and downstream linkages in the supply
chain, well-performing SOEs have contributed by providing reliable goods and services to both
producers and consumers, aligning with their core mandate. Further, kaizen – also known as
Toyota production system – has been introduced in SOEs with the support from Japan International
Cooperation Agency. Implemented in a phased manner, this initiative focuses on eliminating
redundant business processes, wastage and inefficiency, and fostering a culture of continuous
improvement. While systemic institutionalization of this approach will take time, it is expected to
enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of SOEs. Moreover, with the right corporate
governance reforms, similar improvements can be extended to underperforming sectors such as
agriculture and services.
Beyond their direct economic contributions, SOEs have a broader impact on society by
strengthening market infrastructure and facilitating connections between producers and consumers
across both rural and urban areas. In this regard, implementing any counter-cyclical investments
policy and targeted interventions in the market could be made through SOE and will have greater
impact. For instance, the government’s price guarantee scheme is market-conforming
interventions designed to incentivize production by offering higher prices to producers while
simultaneously reducing the cost of living for consumers through lower prices. Furthermore, in
line with the privatization efforts initiated in the 1990s, a well-timed privatization of selected SOEs
could help redistribute wealth from the state to households, fostering inclusive economic growth.
9.3.8 Towards productivity-led growth
Despite several challenges, various opportunities exist for productivity improvement and
economic growth in Bhutan. There is a potential to transition from capital-intensive growth to
productivity-led growth by enhancing capital assimilation (capital deepening). Significant
potential for improvement also lies in strategic resource allocation and prudence in public
investment to optimize resource utilization. Private sector development is another critical element
to improve productivity, as market efficiency will help the private sector allocate resources more
efficiently. Outsourcing market-based activities currently carried out by the government is another
aspect of enhancing productivity. This would boost TFP and ensure long-term economic
sustainability.
107
Years of investment into health and education have resulted in a well-educated workforce in
Bhutan. Consequently, labor quality has been improving across most sectors. Leveraging this
accumulated human capital, improving capital utilization and creating market-led investment plans
could further boost productivity. Identifying key industries with unique selling propositions for
Bhutan, such as arts and crafts, health and mindfulness, biotechnology and food-technology, and
developing the supply and value chains around these industries will help improve the primary and
secondary sectors, and diversify the economy. Finally, the government’s plan of attracting FDI
worth Nu. 500 billion is another key initiative to boost productivity. While foreign investments are
important, FDI is particularly valuable for importing technologies and production know-how,
thereby enhancing efficiency. To achieve this target, it is crucial to position Bhutan as an investor-
friendly destination with access to the South Asian market by adopting fiscal and monetary policies
similar to those of Singapore and Switzerland.
9.4 Conclusion
Bhutan has achieved remarkable economic and social progress over the past few decades, marked
by significant advancements in education and healthcare, poverty reduction, connectivity and
infrastructure development. The progress is evident with the graduation from the LDC category in
2023. However, Bhutan continues to face critical structural challenges such as inefficient capital-
intensive growth model, structural twin deficits, low productivity especially the capital and limited
economic diversification. Heavy reliance on hydropower and tourism, coupled with weak private
sector development, has constrained job creation and productivity growth. The financial sector
also faces high-interest rate spreads combined with high NPL, and weak monetary policy
transmission due to the pegged exchange rate regime. Additionally, supply-side weakness could
cause inflationary pressures and external imbalances as the investments grow in the economy.
Premature deindustrialization and stagnant TFP further weakens Bhutan’s competitiveness. Many
SOEs remain dependent on government support as a result of inefficient operations and
expenditures. The private sector is also inefficient with the market dominated by few industrialists
as a result of high barriers to entry, while MSMEs are unable to upscale due to the small domestic
market and lack of production know-how to compete in the export market. Thus the manufacturing
sector remains underdeveloped and unable to generate meaningful employment. Addressing these
structural issues requires a shift towards private sector-led growth supported by the SOEs, efficient
utilization of capital and enhanced productivity. Diversifying production, fostering innovation and
optimizing capital allocation will be essential for long-term economic growth.
Despite these challenges, Bhutan has significant growth opportunities. The GMC aims to position
Bhutan as a regional economic and financial hub, strengthening energy, connectivity and skills
development. The positive expectation created by visionary GMC initiatives is evident in
significant reduction in exodus and increased inward remittances. Further, fiscal reforms,
particularly GST and income tax reforms, will broaden the tax base and increase compliance. There
108
is also an opportunity to reform the financial market, which can improve investment conditions,
reduce interest rate spread and market inefficiencies. Additionally, Bhutan can leverage its
proximity to India by enhancing FDI inflows, promoting export diversification and creating the
most investor-friendly regulatory environment.
Boosting labor productivity and private sector restructuring is also crucial. The government is
prioritizing workforce upskilling and fostering entrepreneurship to improve efficiency. There is
also an opportunity for privatization of market-based services provided by the government.
Reforms in SOEs have already shown progress, and with further corporate governance
improvements and the adoption of kaizen, it has the opportunity to be the growth accelerator in the
13th FYP. Encouraging private investments, optimizing public expenditure, and supporting high
potential industries – such as arts and crafts, biotech, foodtech, health and wellbeing, IT and high-
skill services – will help transition Bhutan towards a productivity-driven economy. Bhutan’s
ambitious growth target further underscores its commitment to becoming a competitive and
investor-friendly destination.

Preface
This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) examines the key constraints to and opportunities for
accelerating poverty reduction and enhancing shared prosperity in Bhutan. It builds on a large body of
analytical work, evidence gathered in three working sessions within the World Bank Group, and in-country
consultations with civil society organizations, the private sector, government, and development partners.
The report was prepared as an Agile SCD, which follows a menu of interventions, among them streamlined
peer reviews and collaborative working sessions, to give the country engagement model more impact. As
a primary objective, this SCD is expected to inform the next Country Partnership Framework for Bhutan.
In addition, the SCD is also aimed at helping align the World Bank Group around a common understanding
of the constraints and opportunities in the country and to contribute to the public debate on key
development challenges. The SCD team focused on developing a short, self-contained, and accessible
report that is a strategic assessment rather than making explicit policy recommendations or attempting
to summarize all available evidence (though additional resources are noted throughout).
The report was prepared by a team led by Yoichiro Ishihara (World Bank, Resident Representative and
Senior Country Economist for Bhutan), Yeon Soo Kim (World Bank, Economist), Pia Pallavi Trivedi (IFC,
Strategy Officer), and Persephone Economou (MIGA, Senior Risk Management Officer). The core team
included Mona Prasad (World Bank, Lead Economist), Johannes Hoogeveen (World Bank, Lead
Economist), Tenzin Lhaden (World Bank, Operations Officer), Sanjay Srivastava (World Bank, Sustainable
Development Program Leader), Tekabe Ayalew Belay (World Bank, Human Development Program
Leader), Christian Eigen-Zucchi (former World Bank, Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions Program
Leader), Yutaka Yoshino (World Bank, Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions Program Leader), John
Nasir (IFC, Regional Strategy Manager) and Om Bhandari (IFC, Investment Officer). In preparing the SCD,
the team gratefully acknowledges the guidance of Mercy Miyang Tembon (World Bank, Country Director),
Qimiao Fan (World Bank, former Country Director), Mengistu Alemayehu (IFC, Regional Director), Robert
Saum (World Bank, former Country Director), Martin Rama (World Bank, former Chief Economist), Hans
Timmer (World Bank, Chief Economist), Wendy Werner (IFC, Country Manager), Benu Bidani (World Bank,
Practice Manager), Manuela Francisco (World Bank, Practice Manager), Sereen Juma (World Bank,
Country Program Coordinator), Volker Treichel (IFC, Principal Country Economist) and Juri Oka (World
Bank, Senior Strategy and Operations Officer). The team also thanks peer reviewers Genevieve Boyreau

Overview
Bhutan is in many respects a development success story. A small, landlocked country nestled deep in the
Himalayas between India and China, Bhutan has steep mountains and deep valleys, which generated a
pattern of scattered settlement. The country is famous for its unique philosophy — Gross National
Happiness (GNH)— which guides its development. Its abundant water resources created ideal conditions
for hydropower development, which has spurred economic growth. Fiscal revenues from hydropower
have helped finance major investments in human capital that have significantly improved service delivery
and educational and health outcomes. Access to electricity is almost universal, and by 2015, 95 percent
of Bhutanese had access to functional piped water. These achievements are especially remarkable given
Bhutan’s challenging terrain and dispersed population, which elevate the unit costs of providing public
services.
In the last decade, Bhutan cut poverty by two-thirds and achieved lower middle-income country (LMIC)
status. Since the early 1980s, annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 7.5 percent,
making Bhutan one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Gross National Income (GNI) per
capita, at US$3,080 in 2018, is now triple the threshold for LMICs and only 10 percent below the threshold
for upper middle-income countries. Between 2007 and 2017 poverty, measured using the US$3.20
poverty line (in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms), has dropped from 36 to 12 percent. There has
also been good progress in shared prosperity, though in recent years the pace has slowed.
Bhutan possesses the ingredients for continued robust growth. It can continue to reap significant payoffs
as two mega-hydropower projects go into operation between 2022 and 2024/25 and Bhutan’s full
hydropower generation potential is estimated at 30,000 MW. It is also entering a period of demographic
dividend with a young, increasingly educated workforce and declining dependency rates. Moreover, the
full potential of tourism has not yet been tapped, and there are possibilities for Bhutan to enter
international niche markets with organic and sustainably produced agricultural products.
When the mega hydropower projects become operational, Bhutan will have an opportunity to make
the economic realignment and related investments while hydro revenues are still plentiful and in time
to reap the demographic dividend. Efforts to design an appropriate incentive framework and make the
business and investment climate more efficient will take time to bear results, and Bhutan is fortunate that
it will be able to use hydropower revenues during this transition process; realignment could involve short-
term costs in terms of lower growth and higher unemployment, but the cushion provided by the
hydropower revenues will help ease the transition process. The potential boost in job creation could help
Bhutan capitalize on the demographic window of opportunity; a larger, better-educated workforce can
be employed in productive jobs, leading to higher income and faster economic growth—the first
demographic dividend. Further, their ability to generate savings is enhanced by higher incomes and a
lower share of non-working age population, which in turn can contribute to higher growth via greater
investment – an effect known as the second demographic dividend. The recent opening of this window
leaves ample time to reap the benefits of both effects.
However, even with a rich endowment of natural resources and human capital, realization of Bhutan’s
growth potential is not guaranteed. Among the many challenges, the most serious is how best to
establish conditions for enough competitive private-sector jobs to be created. Other challenges include
managing the macroeconomic volatility that comes inevitably with large hydropower projects; ensuring
equal opportunities in a terrain that makes service delivery costly and inefficient; building resilience to
natural disasters and climate change; and ensuring well-intentioned policies are effectively implemented.
The creation of internationally competitive private-sector jobs can help Bhutan fuel future growth. So
far, government and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have created most of the jobs for educated workers
7
in urban areas, providing attractive compensation packages. Queueing for public sector jobs is common,
and the labor force skills mix, especially for better-educated young people, leans toward what the public
sector requires. However, the public sector and the SOEs can no longer fully absorb the expanding and
increasingly educated labor force. SOEs have limited competition and can no longer secure rapid
economic growth through innovation and by exploiting new markets. Hydropower still has growth
potential but is capital-intensive and creates few jobs. The potential for the private sector to create jobs
is likely to be highest in forestry, tourism, and commercial agriculture, based on Bhutan’s competitive
advantage of vast natural resources, and the potential impact on poverty reduction. There is also
significant potential for ICT-enabled services, which would also support regional trade and integration.
Economy-wide, ICT connectivity can help firms access the global market and improve access to finance
through digital channels that can help improve productivity. Well-paid ICT jobs with potential for good
work-life balance could also attract many women into the labor force. To realize its full ICT potential,
Bhutan needs to improve both ICT infrastructure and policies.
There is a need to diversify financing sources and export markets for hydropower. A mega-hydropower
project can cost up to 80 percent of GDP and results in volatility in aggregate demand, both during
construction and when it comes on stream. Since these projects are largely financed by borrowing, they
have resulted in high external deficits and debt. The latter is considered largely sustainable owing to an
agreement with India that covers financial and construction-related hydropower project risks and that
allows for debt service to begin only after projects come on stream. Delays in their construction,
maintenance-related production downtime, and lower rainfall can cause steep declines in hydropower
generation, adversely affecting exports, growth, and revenues. Moreover, the electricity export market in
South Asia is changing fast. India’s new framework for cross-border trade of electricity has added to
uncertainty for Bhutan about access to its markets and conditions for hydropower export. As a result, for
the time being, new mega hydropower projects in Bhutan have been put on hold. In the hydropower
sector, efforts are needed to diversify export markets and financing sources beyond India.
Despite remarkable progress on the twin goals, disparities between urban and rural areas and between
women and men persist. Poverty rates vary widely by district, and over 90 percent of the poor live in
rural areas. They are also much less educated and primarily work in subsistence agriculture, with few
opportunities for non-farm diversification. Gender disparities in economic opportunities persist and the
quality of jobs is lower among women as they are more likely to work in low-paying sectors such as
agriculture. Bhutan’s law gives men and women equal rights but traditional perceptions about gender
roles are still a major barrier to gender parity.
Given the importance of natural assets for growth and jobs, Bhutan could benefit from developing
stronger resilience to natural disasters and climate change. Because it lies in the seismically active
eastern portion of the Himalayan Arc, hydro-meteorological hazards heighten the risks to hydropower
and other sectors. Urbanization has also changed the country’s risk profile because population and assets
are now more heavily concentrated in urban areas.
Finally, implementation gaps have reduced the effectiveness of well-conceptualized policies. The gaps
are mainly caused by differing interpretations of policy because of capacity constraints, poor coordination
within government ministries and agencies, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
Addressing these challenges requires a strategic realignment of Bhutan’s development model.
Developing a vibrant private sector requires continued investment in Bhutan’s asset base of both physical
and human capital, and in institutions. Structural reforms are needed to (a) boost private sector
development; (b) strengthen macro-fiscal stability; (c) invest further in human capital and improve service
delivery; (d) enhance resilience to disaster and climate change; and (e) address the implementation gaps.

1. Increasing access to finance, improving skills mismatches, developing a startup ecosystem,
improving connective infrastructure, and lifting regulatory bottlenecks can support private sector
development and job creation. Financial infrastructure needs enhancement so that firms have more
access to finance, and the education system should broaden skills development programs beyond the
requirements of the public sector. Additional investments are needed for major connective and ICT
infrastructure and the startup ecosystem. In addition, the regulatory environment needs to be more
predictable.
2. Better management of resource rents and fiscal consolidation would enable Bhutan to maintain
macroeconomic stability. The adoption of fiscal stabilization measures will help the government
implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies, thereby reducing fluctuations in aggregate demand and
building fiscal space. To further consolidate its fiscal position, Bhutan also needs to mobilize more
domestic revenues through tax policy reforms, e.g., adopting the goods and services tax (GST) and by
improving tax administration.
3. Greater investments in human capital and service delivery can open up equal opportunities across
all of Bhutan, including for people living in remote areas. Since service delivery is costly and
inefficient in a country with Bhutan’s geography, the spatial trade-offs in development need to be
better understood and reflected in how policies are prioritized and sequenced. Achieving equitable
opportunities and high-quality service provision will also depend on support from policies that enable
migration from remote areas. A stronger social protection system that carefully targets poverty
reduction and offers a tailored package of benefits could do a great deal to heighten the resilience of
households.
4. Greater resilience to natural disasters and climate change can help protect Bhutan’s natural assets
that are central for the country’s growth and jobs. Improved infrastructure and evidence-based
planning is necessary to mitigate Bhutan’s vulnerabilities to climate change and natural disasters. The
poor and vulnerable, who have few coping options, are disproportionately affected by disasters. Also,
natural resources like water need to be carefully managed to ensure that population and production
needs can be met.
5. Finally, while the overall legal and policy framework is relatively robust, stronger implementation
can help improve the effectiveness of well-conceptualized policies. An ambitious and much-needed
reform agenda needs support from by effective implementation arrangements and sound capacity
for evidence-based policy making. That in turn calls for continuing efforts to improve coordination
within the government, address capacity constraints, and keep policy and implementation consistent.
High-quality data and robust statistical analysis must inform not only policy formulation but also M&E
as the policies are being realized in action.

Bhutan Systematic Country Diagnostic
Taking Bhutan’s Development Success to the Next Level
I. Introducing Bhutan
1. Bhutan is a small, landlocked country deep in the eastern Himalayas between India and China.
Over a horizontal distance of just 100–150 km, the elevation rises from about 150 meters above sea level
in the south to over 7,000 meters in the north. The population of about 735,0001 is scattered across steep
mountain slopes and valleys, many in remote and far-flung hamlets. This makes Bhutan one of the most
sparsely populated countries in the world, ranked 182 out of 215 countries.2 Nearly half the land area is
protected to help preserve biodiversity. With forest coverage exceeding 70 percent, Bhutan is the only
carbon-negative country in the world, absorbing more greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than it
produces—and not counting the carbon that its hydropower exports displace in India. Bhutan started
opening up to the outside world only in the early 2000s but its political and economic ties are still mainly
with India. Despite sharing a long border with China in the north, the formal relationship is limited.
Bhutan’s independence throughout its history has helped preserve its rich cultural heritage and traditions.
As its development policies demonstrate, Bhutan strives to be self-sufficient and to conserve its
environment and culture.
2. Bhutan’s unique development philosophy—GNH—guides its development plans, emphasizing
a holistic and inclusive approach to sustainable development.3 The four pillars of GNH are (a) good
governance, (b) sustainable socioeconomic development, (c) preservation and promotion of culture, and
(d) conserving the environment. Since 2008, Bhutan has had a development management system guided
by the Constitution, with development strategies and annual budgets driven by GHN principles. The GNH
Index and the GNH Policy Screening Tool are its main instruments for operationalizing GNH into the
formulation of development policies. The GNH Index measures Bhutan’s progress toward maximizing
GNH; the GNH Policy Screening Tool assesses how a new policy will affect GNH. Many of Bhutan’s
development achievements can be attributed to this unique development framework, which has been
supported by continued efforts to ensure good governance.
3. In 2008 Bhutan transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a democratic, constitutional
monarchy. The King is the head of the state, but executive power is vested in the government, headed by
the Prime Minister. Since 2008 Bhutan has held three elections; each time a different political party was
elected into office. In the 2018 election, the People-Centered and Pragmatic Party (DNT) was elected; its
slogan was “Narrowing the Gap.” Bhutan performs well on indicators of control of corruption and peace,
ranking 25 of 180 countries in the 2018 Corruption Perception Index4 and 19 of 163 countries in the 2018
Global Peace Index.5
4. Bhutan’s geography is ideal for hydropower development, which has spurred economic growth
and helped establish Bhutan as a lower middle-income country (see appendix 2). Abundant water
resources—Bhutan is among the top five countries in the world for water availability per capita—and the
drop-in elevation from north to south creates ideal conditions for run-off-the-river hydropower

National Happiness.”

generation. Large scale electricity generation for both domestic consumption and export began with the
commissioning of the 336 MW Chukha hydropower project in 1988 (construction had begun in 1974).
Several more hydropower plants have since come on stream, notably the mega Tala hydropower project
in 2007, which tripled Bhutan’s hydroelectricity capacity. While the project cost can be the equivalent of
70–80 percent of GDP, the average cost of developing hydropower capacity in Bhutan is about US$1
million per MW, which is lower than in most other countries. Under the current model, the Druk Green
Power Corporation (DGPC, an SOE) serves as developer and then owner of the hydropower project in
Bhutan, with India financing and constructing the projects and importing the surplus electricity.
Hydropower revenues are essential to financing the government, and are collected through corporate
taxes, dividends, royalties (in-kind electricity sold domestically), and one-time profit transfers from a
project company in the first year of hydropower operation. Bhutan’s full hydropower generation potential
is estimated at 30,000 MW.6 Of this, 2,326 MW has already been constructed and capacity is projected to
rise with the completion of Punatsangchhu (I and II) by 2024/25. These two projects will add another
2,938 MW of generation capacity.
5. Hydropower revenues have enabled Bhutan to invest heavily in physical and human capital and
to expand access to basic services. The constitution mandates that the government provides education
and health services. Both are free and are predominantly financed and delivered by the public sector.7
This has led to considerable improvements in access to formal education and in health outcomes. Access
to basic services, such as electricity, water, and sanitation, has also gone up significantly. However, though
access has improved in many areas, particularly at primary levels, service quality and inequities in access
are still a major concern.
6. Although ideal for hydropower generation, the topography and extreme variations in altitude
limit connectivity, especially in remote areas, and thus access to services, markets, and jobs. Sparse
settlement patterns and challenging geography steeply elevate unit costs and make it extremely difficult
to expand service delivery, especially in remote areas. These circumstances raise questions about how to
expand access to services in a fiscally sustainable way. Poverty rates vary widely across districts (figure 1);
poverty is concentrated in rural, remote areas where there is little access not only to services but also to
non-farm formal job opportunities.
7. Bhutan must deal with substantial risks arising from natural disasters, which climate change will
exacerbate—the effects of climate change are especially acute in the Himalayan region. Extreme weather
leads to fluctuations in hydropower, the main driver of growth, and affect agricultural production, the
main source of livelihoods for the poor. Since Bhutan is in one of the most seismically active zones in the
world, it is often threatened by earthquakes, landslides, floods, and outbursts of glacial lakes.

private cabins in government hospitals, cosmetic surgical and dental care, and cost for obtaining a medical
certificate (WHO 2017).

II. Bhutan’s development success story – high growth, great strides in poverty alleviation and human
and physical capital development
Hydropower has contributed to rapid GDP growth mainly through elevated investment and export
earnings. GDP grew at an annualized average of 7.5 percent from 1981 through 2017, making it one of
the top five fastest-growing economies in the world. GDP per capita rose almost ten-fold, from US$332 in
1980 to US$3,360 in 2018 (figure 2). Since the early 2000s hydropower exports have quintupled; in 2017
they accounted for 29 percent of total exports, and Bhutan’s investment (i.e., gross fixed capital
formation) has been exceeding 50 percent of GDP, again one of the highest rates in the world.
Hydropower revenues accounted for 18 percent of total government revenues. As hydropower
development accelerated, the relative contribution of agriculture to GDP fell from 45 to 13 percent. Over

the period the share of non-manufacturing industry, most of which is hydropower, rose from 21 to 34
percent. The share of services also went up, from 26 to 39 percent, primarily because growth in tourism
stimulated activity in retail and wholesale trade and hotels and restaurants (figure 3).
8. Bhutan has judiciously invested its hydropower revenues in human and physical capital with
extraordinary success. Infant mortality plunged from about 130 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 26 in 2017,
due to better primary health care and greater access to potable drinking water. Except for Sri Lanka and
the Maldives, this is the lowest rate in South Asia. Health outcomes for women also blossomed: the
adolescent fertility rate, measured as births per 1,000 women, fell from 109 in 1980 to 20 in 2015, and
maternal mortality from 945 per 100,000 births in 1990 to 148 in 2015. As a result of large investments in
health facilities and free health care, Bhutan’s health care system does well in terms of coverage,
affordability and availability: as of 2017, 91 percent of the population lived within one-hour distance from
a health facility,8 significantly better than the 73 percent in 2007. Most of the remaining gaps are in rural,
remote areas. High access to government health facilities has helped keep out-of-pocket expenditure low,
at 12 percent in 2014, providing financial protection to households. However, much of health-related out-
of-pocket spending is on transport, which likely affects access to services.
9. As of 2017, enrollment in primary education was nearly universal, having jumped 30 percentage
points in just a decade. Net secondary enrollment also expanded rapidly, surpassing 70 percent in 2017.
Tertiary enrollment is still low, but Bhutan is now emphasizing technical and vocational education and
training (TVET) as well as tertiary education.9 Enrollment of women at all levels is also higher—significant
progress considering that literacy and educational achievement are lower among older Bhutanese. Access
to electricity is almost universal, up from just 25 percent in 2000. Public investment in infrastructure has
significantly expanded road networks: farm roads expanded from 1,700 km in 2008 to 11,200 km in 2017.
All districts and subdistricts are connected by fiberoptic networks that provide the foundation for digital
infrastructure.

area contrasts with the acceleration of growth in the consumption growth of the total population, from
4.2 percent in 2007–12 to 4.8 percent in 2012–17.

12. Poverty rates vary widely by district, and poverty is almost exclusively rural. While most districts
have made steady progress in reducing poverty, as of 2017 it was still above 35 percent in Dagana and
Zhemgang. Samtse has the most poor people (13.2 percent), followed by Dagana (12 percent) and
Monggar (11.4 percent); together they account for more than a third of Bhutan’s poor. Some of these
districts are also geographically remote, making access to services and markets difficult.

price and weather shocks make households
highly vulnerable. This is especially the case for poor households. Simple simulations show that a 20
percent increase in the poverty line would almost double the 2017 poverty rate, from 12.1 to 20.1 percent.
This suggests that while welfare improved and poverty declined, many households are still in a tight
cluster at the lower end of the welfare distribution and at risk of falling back into poverty. Moreover, the
social protection system is weak, and while opportunities for non-farm diversification could help mitigate
the impact of shocks, such opportunities are rare. For almost 80 percent of poor households, every
working household member is engaged in agriculture.
16. Gender disparities in economic opportunity persist. In recent years female labor force
participation declined, to 56 percent in 2018. Although that is still significantly higher than most other
South Asian countries, it still averaged 14 percentage points lower than male participation, and fell short
for almost all age groups, suggesting that women’s opportunities and career choices are limited
throughout their life cycle.12 Indeed, powerful gender norms still dictate that child care and most
household chores are women’s responsibility. Women are more likely to work in low-paying sectors like
agriculture or are family workers. Women’s earnings average only about 75 percent of men’s, with some
differences attributable to gaps in education and occupational segregation.13 The proportion of female
managers in cottage and small industries (CSIs) in all sectors is also considerably lower, suggesting
constraints on their entrepreneurial activities. While there are no particular gender differences in access
to finance, neither are there regulations and provisions to encourage female entrepreneurship. Extension
officers are in chronically short supply and female officers are even fewer, despite evidence that female
farmers are more likely to consult female extension officers. The low literacy of Bhutanese women,
particularly in rural areas, further limits their access to information and market,

17. The law stipulates that men and women have equal rights to inheritance, but traditional
customs determine actual practices. These differ by region: in matrilineal communities in the western
and central regions, women traditionally inherit land and property, but in the southern and eastern
regions, men tend to inherit. However, even though many women have land registered in their names,
the benefits are limited, because land is typically not used as collateral for financing and its sale or rental
is difficult. That may also deter migration of women to urban areas in search of better opportunities.
Moreover, women have limited agency over their land because husbands still often make the decisions.
18. Although Bhutan’s law gives women and men equal rights, perceptions of gender are a major
challenge. Bhutan has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
against Women, which is being progressively implemented; a Gender Equality Policy is now waiting for
cabinet approval. However, social perceptions and behavior related to gender-specific roles vary along
regional lines, with the patrilineal system dominant in southern areas. In general, traditional beliefs have
not restricted women’s involvement in agriculture, household decision-making, and property inheritance,
but their activities outside the community are less tolerated, especially in rural areas.14 Empowering
women is not easy: In a 2010 survey, 26 percent of rural women aged 15–49 had experienced domestic
violence and 72 percent believed that a man is justified in beating his wife or partner.15 Few women
participate in politics.
III. A young and more educated demographic profile offers opportunities for Bhutan’s next stage of
development, but private sector development is still lackluster.
19. Hydropower has been the primary driver of growth, but because it is capital-intensive,
employment is still dominated by agriculture. Hydropower accounts for less than 1 percent of the jobs,
and hydropower construction relies extensively on foreign labor. About 58 percent of Bhutan’s labor force
are engaged in agriculture, although it accounts for

only 13 percent of GDP because it is dominated by low-productivity, subsistence farming (figure 7). There
is likely also significant disguised unemployment with workers engaged in low-productivity activities.
Industry accounts for only 10 percent of total employment and services employ the remaining 32 percent
(figure 8). The share of manufacturing in GDP is less than 10 percent and there has been limited
development of high-productivity services like information and communication technology (ICT) and
finance.
20. Despite government efforts to provide a more enabling environment, the underdeveloped
private sector is dominated by small and micro firms, primarily operating informally.16 Bhutan has
implemented a range of regulatory and business environment reforms, but it has only a handful of large
companies, and many small firms are struggling to grow. As of June 2017, there were 43,505 industrial
establishments, the overwhelming majority in services (14,528) and trade (22,972). Only 2,125 were in
manufacturing. Of the 20,000 establishments that are licensed, more than 95 percent are registered under
sole proprietorships. Enterprise survey results show that only 3.4 percent of businesses export at least 10
percent of their sales directly, significantly less than the South Asian average of 7.3 percent.
21. Meanwhile, Bhutan relies heavily on

is 100 percent government-owned. In the past five
years, more than 10 SOEs were established. The
MoF oversees socially oriented SOEs and DHI those that are commercial (table 2), although several SOEs
under the MoF operate in commercial sectors.18 Although autonomous, DHI has close links with the MoF
and provides dividends to the budget at an amount agreed annually. Through dividends and corporate
income taxes, in 2017 SOEs accounted for 37 percent of government revenues. Gross revenues of SOEs
were equivalent to 30 percent of GDP, and the net profit-to-revenues ratio reached 20 percent. The size
of SOEs has also expanded in recent years: between 2008 and 2018 alone, DHI assets more than tripled,
from more than Nu 50 billion to more than Nu 180 billion. The combined asset value of SOEs is equivalent
to 143 percent of GDP (figure 9).
16 Estimates of the magnitude of the informal sector are not reliable, but the figure is expected to be high given the
predominance of micro firms.

22. The presence of SOEs may have crowded out private firms in some commercial sectors. In
principle, SOEs should be created in sectors where there is market failure (e.g., provision of public goods)
or that are strategically important (e.g., defense). However, in Bhutan, SOEs are also present in banking,
insurance, telecoms, airline, manufacturing, cement, and mining where the private sector could play a
more active role. Also, the rationale for having SOEs in manufacturing, agriculture, and real estate is not
clear, and they may be crowding out opportunities for the private sector.19 The profitability of most SOEs
is largely driven by those in energy and finance, and by the lack of competition.20 Despite the
government’s role as regulator, it has reduced competition by granting SOEs subsidies, preferential tax
treatment, and exemptions; in-kind benefits; and concessional financing and guarantees. There are no

competitive neutrality arrangements that would require all firms to be governed by the same rules and
policies, and resource allocation is distorted because the prices SOEs charge do not fully cover their costs.
This could give them a competitive edge that shifts production away from the most efficient producers.

to create jobs in urban areas will intensify.
21 The United Nations defines the demographic window as open when the proportion of youth in the total population
raises above 30 percent and the proportion of the elderly is below 15 percent. Intuitively, as a country’s young bulge
reaches working age, a country enters a demographic window of opportunity. An expanding working-age population
(those persons aged 15 –64) generates a labor supply effect that, under certain conditions, can propel economic
growth and lift incomes.
22 Data availability and comparability issues (mainly stemming from a change in the timing of the Labor Force
Survey) make it difficult to examine certain trends in employment before 2013.

IV. Hydropower has served Bhutan’s development well, but changes in the outlook of the energy
sector call for alternative sources of growth beyond hydropower
26. Rapid evolution of the electricity export market in South Asia is changing the outlook.
Hydropower has driven Bhutan’s development success by contributing to GDP growth and enabling
investments in physical and human capital. However, the future is less certain. High economic growth in
the region will require a steep increase in power supply in coming decades. India alone is estimating that
in the next few decades it will need more than 300,000 MW of additional renewable energy capacity.
Together with political preferences to reduce carbon growth, this could create opportunities for Bhutan’s
hydropower as a reliable renewable power source. However, solar photo-voltaic (PV) is driving down the
cost for large- as well as small-scale power generation to levels close to Nu. 3/kWh. This is comparable to
the cost of hydropower from Dagachhu, which is traded on the open market through Tata Power at a tariff
21
of 2.96 Nu/kWh.23 Further, if adoption of battery storage technologies accelerates over the next decade,
future development of hydropower will become ever more irrelevant. Even if reliability and provision of
peak power and ancillary services are essential benefits of hydropower compared to solar PV, hydropower
will find it difficult to stay competitive because of higher costs and environmental and social requirements.
27. There is a need to diversify financing sources and export markets for hydropower. To date,
almost all Bhutan’s hydropower projects have been financed by India, which takes all its hydroelectricity
exports. However, it has become more difficult to raise financing from India for new hydropower projects.
In recent years, India has encouraged Bhutan to form joint ventures with Indian Central Public-Sector
Undertakings (CPSUs) for financing and constructing new hydropower projects.24 The large size of the
hydro projects and contracts makes it difficult for Bhutanese companies to participate. Moreover, India
recently adopted a new protocol for cross-border trade in electricity which states that only companies
fully owned by the governments of the countries concerned or with at least a 51 percent equity
investment by Indian public or private companies may export power to the Indian market.25 While the
guidelines aim to promote regulatory transparency, consistency, and predictability in cross-border trade,
they have increased the uncertainty of access to markets and conditions for Bhutan’s hydropower exports
to other countries such as Bangladesh.
28. The changing landscape of the regional hydropower sector prompted the government in June
2017 to assign a high-level committee to review Bhutan’s future hydropower development plans.
Although the committee has finalized its recommendations, they have not yet been made public. The
committee has apparently recommended completing the construction of on-going projects and putting
new ones on hold for the time being. Together with the outlook for the regional energy sector, this would
have significant implications for Bhutan’s development model, which has revolved around hydropower.
29. Uncertainty over the future of hydropower development and the need to gainfully employ a
more educated cohort of young Bhutanese calls for realignment of the growth model. Given the
developments in the renewable energy sector in South Asia, it will be important for Bhutan to invest in
alternative sources of growth. Under the status quo scenario, Bhutan’s growth is projected to decelerate
abruptly after 2021 and fall below 3 percent in less than a decade.26 For Bhutanese to be able to
participate in the growth sectors of tomorrow will require continued investment in building the relevant
skill sets and physical and institutional capital—the country’s asset base.
30. When the mega hydropower projects under construction become operational, Bhutan will have
an opportunity to make the economic realignment and related investments while hydro revenues are
still plentiful and in time to reap the demographic dividend. Efforts to design an appropriate incentive
framework and make the business and investment climate more efficient will take time to bear results,
and Bhutan is fortunate that it will be able to use hydropower revenues during this transition process;
realignment could involve short-term costs in terms of lower growth and higher unemployment, but the
cushion provided by the hydropower revenues will help ease the transition process. The potential boost
in job creation could help Bhutan capitalize on the demographic window of opportunity; a larger, better-
educated workforce can be employed in productive jobs, leading to higher income and faster economic
growth—the first demographic dividend. Further, their ability to generate savings is enhanced by higher
23 Current export tariffs for existing hydropower plants in long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are 2.55
Nu/kWh for Chukha and 2.12 Nu/kWh for Tala and Kurichhu.
24 Kholongchhu Hydro, a JV with SJVN Ltd. (a CPSU under the Government of India), is one such example but the
model has been facing challenges with the concession agreement for Kholongchhu still to be signed.
25 India issued the Guidelines on Cross Border Trade of Electricity in 2016 and revised them in late 2018.

capital and total factor productivity. World Bank 2019, “Bhutan Development Report.”
22
incomes and a lower share of non-working age population, which in turn can contribute to higher growth
via greater investment – an effect known as the second demographic dividend. The recent opening of this
window leaves ample time to reap the benefits of both effects.
31. The hydropower sector will continue to play a dominant role in the economy, and some
modifications in the sector will be beneficial. There is a need to diversify the hydropower export market
and identify alternative sources of financing. Investing in small and medium-sized as well as mega-
hydropower projects could help reduce the risk of depending too heavily on a few mega-projects.
Managing smaller projects could also help build the required capacity in the domestic market and
establish vertical and horizontal links. Better management of environmental and social effects and
improvements in the design and construction stage could help limit time and cost overruns, which have
been frequent and rampant. Such improvements will depend on efforts to build capacity.27. Participation
of the private sector in the hydropower sector could be encouraged.
V. Taking Bhutan’s development success to the next level
32. This SCD advocates for a realignment of priorities so that Bhutan can achieve long-term poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. It first identifies specific areas where bottlenecks can be dismantled. It
then identifies cross-cutting themes on which to base further progress. Among the specific areas are (a)
boosting private sector development; (b) strengthening macro-fiscal stability; and (c) investing in human
capital and improving service delivery. Among the cross-cutting themes are (a) enhancing disaster and
climate resilience; and (b) addressing implementation gaps.

and low connectivity makes it difficult for local
producers to become part of global value

led to a significant extension of road networks:

6,920 kms of motorable roads. Together with
investments in telecommunication systems,
these have improved the physical and digital

performance, both domestically and along
transit corridors. Bhutan’s logistics performance is low and has not improved for a decade: it ranks 135th
of 160 countries in the international Logistics Performance Index (figure 13). In South Asia, only
Afghanistan’s LPI is worse (figure 14). Inefficiencies at the Indian Port of Kolkata limit the access of
Bhutanese producers to third-country markets. Bhutan has only three domestic airports, and air
connectivity is subject to frequent delays and cancellations. Demand for transport services is high: recent
surveys found that for households, roads are the top priority for government intervention.
35. Investing in connective infrastructure could pay high dividends in terms of market access and
growth by connecting smaller places to large urban centers. As with other investments, infrastructure
investments have also been driven by spatial trade-offs, in this case the cost and benefit of investing in
major vs minor roads. The 2006 Road Masterplan gave more attention to construction of feeder roads,28
possibly because of equity concerns, and less to large connective infrastructure. These feeder roads have
helped improve mobility of the population in rural and remote areas, where settlements tend to occupy
mountain slopes and hilltops. However, major transport infrastructure (e.g., the East-West Highway) is
essential to ease economy-wide constraints on connectivity, link producers to markets, and allow Bhutan
to take advantage of external opportunities, in the region and globally.
36. Limited connectivity and mobility have also lowered the benefits of agglomeration economies
in Bhutan’s rapidly urbanizing centers.29 The four municipalities have infrastructure and service delivery
backlogs, a shortage of serviced land, water shortages, too little affordable housing, and environmental
pollution. For example, Thimphu district, which contains Thimphu municipality, and Chhukha district, with
Phuentsholing municipality, have the most households without reliable water, and traffic congestion is a
key issue in both. Only 20 percent of households in Thimphu have sewer connections. In leading cities like
Thimphu and Phunthosling, where about 80 percent of private firms are located, efforts should focus on
improving livability, reducing disparities in access to services, and leveraging urban agglomerations for
deeper and more diverse private investments.

24
37. In the 2010s, the number of vehicles doubled in Bhutan, and half of them are registered in
Thimphu,30 where traffic jams are persistent. Thus, there is a clear need to expand the road network and
consider a reliable public transportation system—which would significantly enhance livability. For
urbanizing areas with locational advantages and nascent economic clusters, such as Gelephu, Samdrup
Jongkhar and Mongar, it would be useful to improve conditions for private investment by links to potential
markets in emerging sectors such as high-value and organic agribusiness, agroprocessing, and
manufacture, and scaling up micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and cottage industries by
improving connectivity. In sparse rural areas and small rural towns, it is critical that residents achieve a
decent standard of living; investment in human capital is necessary if they are to access productive
opportunities. The differentiated regional development approach will promote private sector
development in leading cities through agglomeration and in rural areas by addressing equity through
targeted investments in service delivery.
38. South Asia as a whole trails on regional trade and integration, and Bhutan is no exception. There
are four critical barriers to promoting regional integration: (a) border tax distortions, (b) nontariff barriers,
(c) connectivity costs, and (d) a trust deficit31. For landlocked countries like Bhutan, lack of efficient transit
through neighboring countries can push up the costs of transportation and logistics, and thus prices for
imported consumer goods, both essential and nonessential, as well as other inputs. Similarly, higher
transportation and logistics costs can often render products from landlocked areas uncompetitive beyond
local markets, thus confining them to production in volumes too small to reap economies of scale. In
Bhutan’s case, those markets are limited to its own territory and to nearby countries32.
39. Diversification of export markets and products remains low. India accounts for 85 percent of
Bhutan’s exports, followed by Bangladesh (9 percent) and the United States (1 percent). Besides
hydroelectricity, which accounted for 29 percent of exports, the main export commodities are base metals
(31 percent) and minerals (19 percent), most of which have little value-added. Few agricultural products
other than cardamom are exported. The main export items are thus capital-intensive and create few jobs.
The private sector could participate in smaller-scale hydropower projects, which might lead to
development of energy-intensive industries and vertical and horizontal links. Digital tools and platforms
would allow Bhutanese firms to engage in e-commerce, overcoming physical barriers to trade. Banking,
tourism, and retail can be adapted to become highly digitized. Other digitally-enabled innovations, such
as 3D printing and drones, could transform traditional sectors like transport and manufacturing, leading
to new firms and jobs and access to new markets. The efficiency gains could however also lead to
displacement of lagging firms and workers.
40. There is significant potential for ICT-enabled services that could support regional and global
trade. The proliferation of digital technologies globally creates opportunities for individuals and
businesses in landlocked countries like Bhutan to link with markets and trade flows. These opportunities
flow not only from the ICT sector itself but also from use of ICT in sectors across the economy. This creates
new sources of growth as transaction costs fall and markets expand. The Internet and digital technologies
are reshaping employment globally, expanding opportunities for higher-skilled workers and linking more
low-skilled workers to markets, but there may be risks for some, especially the middle-skilled, who might
lose out due to automation and other disruptive technologies likely in the next few decades. ICT-enabled

services provide opportunities in areas where transport connectivity, a key constraint for Bhutan, is
significantly binding. Despite having an ICT policy and strategy in place,33 ICT development has been very
slow. The country is ranked 121 out of 176 in the 2017 ICT Development Index, which takes into account
access, use, and ICT-related skills. Fast, reliable, and affordable Internet connectivity with the rest of the
world is essential for these services to develop. Bhutan’s fiberoptic network within the country already
provides the infrastructure to promote business incubation and potential startups in the ICT sector.
However, costly and low-speed Internet connections and low technical skills have made it hard to build
ICT-enabled regional services, e.g., for efficient cross-border trade. Internet backbone redundancy and
improved speed and reliability, along with skills development, could greatly help ICT startups. Economy-
wide, ICT connectivity can help firms access the global market and improve access to finance through
digital channels that can help improve productivity.34 Well-paid ICT jobs with potential for good work-life
balance could also attract many women into the labor force.
41. To realize its full ICT potential, Bhutan needs to improve both ICT infrastructure and policies. In
the ICT sector, including IT-enabled services, Bhutan has made progress in recent years, for instance, it
established the Thimphu Tech Park along with enabling government policies. Nevertheless, the use of IT
in the economy is still limited. Only a fifth of Bhutanese older than 15 have made or received a digital
payment, compared with a third in Bangladesh and almost half in Sri Lanka.35 Currently, Bhutan has no e-
commerce strategy, and e-commerce activities are minimal.36 Skills are also a weakness. And limited
digitization of the economy means fewer job prospects for the 300 ICT graduates who enter the workforce
every year. Appropriate policies can help Bhutan to take advantage of digital technologies and to use ICT
to make its people and its businesses more productive and better connected. High priorities, then, are to
(a) improve access to affordable and high-quality Internet across Bhutan so that all individuals and
businesses can be part of the digital economy; (b) encourage greater digitization of financial services,
tourism, and other key sectors of the economy, building on previous initiatives; and (c) create an
environment that enables digital innovations like e-commerce to reach smaller businesses and rural areas
so that they can benefit from Bhutan's digital future.
42. Access to finance is the most binding business-related obstacle, and financial inclusion among
individuals is among the lowest in the region.37 The three biggest banks and the largest insurance
company are state-owned—the public sector controls 90 percent of total financial sector assets. State
intervention extends from ownership of financial institutions to priority sector lending and a controlled
interest rate regime, restricting competition, the supply of financial products and services, and financial
innovation. The financial infrastructure is also poor: there is limited credit information, narrow use of
productive collateral, and an ineffective insolvency regime – as well as a lack of financial literacy.38 With
shallow capital markets and excess liquidity in the banking system, the financial sector is undiversified.39
Yet, the banking sector faces maturity and concentration risk: credit is concentrated in housing (24
percent) and tourism and services (23 percent) while manufacturing, agribusiness, and other sectors have
limited access.40 Financial inclusion of individuals is among the lowest in the region; in 2014 only 34

percent of adults had a bank account.41 Access to banking is even lower among those living in rural areas
(31 percent), those in the bottom 40 (25 percent), and women (28 percent).42 The difficult terrain and the
scattered population make it commercially unviable for banks to open branches in many rural areas. The
government has made MSME development a priority; it provides viable opportunities for private sector
growth and job creation. Despite actively pursuing payment systems solutions and high mobile phone
penetration, however, the use of mobile banking remains nascent.43 With liquidity in the domestic market
limited, external commercial borrowing (ECB) from non-resident lenders in the form of bank loans or
suppliers’ credits may be a way to expand access to finance. In 2012 the MoF formulated ECB guidelines
to facilitate borrowing by Bhutanese businesses,44 but they do not serve this purpose because of issues
with (a) eligible lenders, (b) all-in-cost ceiling, (c) debt-equity ratio, (d) end use of funds, (d) administrative
process and (e) threshold on automatic approval. In addition, the ECB guidelines do not allow banks to
borrow externally.45
43. Financial sector development, existing rules and regulations and financial infrastructure remain
a challenge. Key legislation, rules and regulations are underdeveloped in banking and have yet to be
established in insurance, pensions, and payment systems. This deters not only prudential supervision and
regulation but also development of a fair, competitive market. A rudimentary Financial Intelligence Unit,
credit bureau, central registry, and stock exchange have been established but are not far along, and there
is little use of movable collateral and credit information. On average collateral must cover 179 percent of
the loan amount, and the prevailing practice is to accept only fixed assets. Managing asset liability is also
challenging, so long-term funding is rare. Though Bhutan began issuing Treasury bonds in 2009, as yet
there is no active market, so the government borrows directly from state-controlled banks. Insurance
companies and pension funds are engaged in retail lending but lack alternative assets.
44. The shortage of skilled labor is another key challenge for firms. Despite rapid improvements in
access to education, the general skill level is low: 17 percent of Bhutanese aged 15–29, and 57 percent of
those aged 30–49, have never attended school; only 30 percent have completed secondary education. To
improve basic competencies, non-formal education programs have helped raise the literacy and numeracy
of more than 200,000 individuals who had no opportunity to participate in formal schooling.46 However,
the labor market relevance of these programs remains a concern. Secondary enrollment has been rising
but the transition to post-school opportunities (e.g. TVET) is not smooth. Though industry demand for
TVET graduates is growing, few students pursue it. Vocational training institutes have limited capacity and
there is a mismatch between the curriculum and labor market needs. Vocational institutes are also not
certified and lack awareness on the requirements of the employers. Access to tertiary education has
improved but intake capacity is low; as a result, a large number of students pursue tertiary education
abroad. Moreover, jobs in the public sector are so attractive that, because of its compensation and benefit
packages, many students major in general subjects like commerce, which has contributed to the shortage

46 Non-formal education programs provide alternative educational programs for individuals who missed the
opportunity to participate in formal schooling or training, by improving basic literacy and numeracy skills. From
1992 to 2017, the programs benefited 203,471 learners, 71 percent of them women. The government has recently
adopted a non-formal education equivalency framework which provides a formal basis for evaluating alternative
educational credentials and offers flexible pathways to achieve education and obtain relevant skills.

than those
employed in the rural, agricultural, and forestry sector, and thus not likely to take on manual jobs, but
who do not have the competencies the public sector requires. Prudent use of migrant workers could help
fill critical labor shortages. Also, employers could benefit from more flexibility in recruiting skilled labor.
Immigration flows could be managed to align with market demand, while recognizing the need for
different types of migrants and minimizing any negative impact immigration may have on Bhutanese
workers.
45. Low technical and noncognitive skills are often serious concerns of employers. About 60 percent
of nonfarm private sector employers believe their workers have insufficient ICT skills, and 35–40 percent
believe they have insufficient teamwork, leadership and problem-solving skills.47 An extensive
international literature shows that the foundations for these types of skills are laid early in life. There is
increasing emphasis on early childhood development (ECD) but in Bhutan access is still low, and since
most ECD centers are in urban areas and operated by private providers, they are unaffordable for low-
income households. For adults, interventions could focus on education and training opportunities to
develop the core technical and soft skills in demand in the private sector.
46. The presence of a large public sector with an attractive compensation package has made it
difficult for the private sector to attract skilled labor. Although the pay gap between private and public
sector workers is mainly attributed to differences in qualifications, public sector workers enjoy job security
and a better compensation package with such benefits as a contributory pension. In a survey of
unemployed youth, 50.3 percent said they would prefer to work for the government and another 32.4
percent aspired to work in an SOE.48 Anecdotal evidence confirms that unemployed individuals often do
not take up private sector job offers and instead choose to wait, hoping to get public employment.
47 World Bank (2017) “Investment Climate Assessment”
48 MoLHR and United Nations Development Programme (2013) “Youth Unemployment in Bhutan”
28
Queueing for public jobs is common, especially among educated youth, reflecting high reservation wages
that contributes to the youth unemployment. In the absence of formal unemployment support, these
youth tend to be supported by the extended family network. However, the government has limited
capacity to absorb all of them.49 The preference for public sector jobs creates incentives to accumulate
skills that cater to the public sector, with more students opting for general university level education
rather than specializing in different fields through university or vocational training. In effect, the public
sector reduces the pool of qualified workers available for the private sector, for which finding skilled labor
is the second biggest constraint after access to finance.
47. Accelerating reforms to improve the business climate is critical. Bhutan’s ranking in the World
Bank Doing Business report slipped from 70 in 2014 to 89 in 2019; clearly, there has been little progress.
Although Bhutan’s politics are stable, corruption is low, and electricity is cheap, there are serious
difficulties in doing business. For example, approval of the Movable and Immovable Property Bill and the
Insolvency Bill has been delayed for years. The recent appointment of the private sector development
committee is commendable, but policy and practice have not been responsive to the needs of the private
sector.50 There are several areas where Bhutan has made progress but more is needed: (a) Credit is
improving due to expansion of collateralizable assets and deepening of the credit bureaus; this process
needs to continue. (b) The National Land Commission has made progress in land registration and online
portals; this process should be accelerated. (c) Finally, recent attempts to reform the laws and institutions,
especially as they relate to registering and setting up businesses and protecting minority investors, need
to be intensified. Moreover, a comprehensive suite of services beyond regulatory reforms is needed to
support the growth of MSMEs and also improve labor market outcomes for women, who are more likely
to be self-employed. Small enterprises often lack support in such areas as training on basic skills to help
them grow or use new technologies, formulate business plans, cultivating market links, and applying good
business practices.
48. Reviewing the role of SOEs and their impact on competition and markets could help redefine
the state’s role as a facilitator. In 2019 the government issued Corporate Governance Guideline for State
Enterprises51 and started reviewing the roles of SOEs and their implications for private-sector-led
development. Bhutan could consider a range of different reform options: (a) increasing the role of the
private sector, for example, in manufacturing and agribusiness; (b) reducing the role of the state to
minority shareholder; (c) further corporatizing government functions; (d) improving corporate
governance; and (e) divestment and privatization of SOEs. Where necessary, the state could reduce its
role in the market and establish itself as a facilitator rather than a participant, which would promote
growth of the private sector.
49. Targeted reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) will be crucial.52 FDI is important to
Bhutan as a source of capital, innovation, and management expertise, and in enabling access to external
markets. Yet FDI inflows to Bhutan have been less than US$20 million a year since 2010 and much lower
as a share of GDP than in other South Asian countries.53 Also, FDI to Bhutan is concentrated in tourism (42
49 Competition among similarly qualified individuals is also high as the number of students enrolled in tertiary
education was less than 700 in 2002 but had increased to more than 17,000 in 2018. In 2018, only 1,287 civil
servants were recruited49.

However, there are equity restrictions, which differ for nonpriority sectors. The 2010 FDI policy (amended
in 2014) used a “negative list” approach to entry barriers. However, some equity restrictions might need
to be revised to ensure that desirable investments are not inhibited. One example is the minimum
investment threshold in the hotel sector. The purpose of the restriction is to attract high-value, low-impact
tourism, but investment size is not necessarily the best tool to achieve this objective. Minimum project
size, prohibitions of specific projects, access to convertible currency, and a long list of submissions needed
for registration of FDI projects have deterred rather than attracting FDI.
50. A recent revision to the 2010 FDI policy is expected to attract increased foreign investments.
Some of the key improvements include the following: (a) streamlining of the approval process with a single
window for FDI investors at the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (b) opening of select small scale production
and manufacturing activities to FDI; (c) removal of the minimum investment size for the IT sector and an
increase in the maximum foreign ownership in the sector to 100 percent; (d) opening of select
infrastructure sectors to FDI through public private partnership arrangements; (e) facilitation of business
visas for foreign investors; and (f) provisions allowing local joint venture investors to purchase convertible
currency from the RMA to meet the initial capital investment requirements.
51. While the legal and policy framework for private sector development is relatively robust,
implementation gaps reduce their effectiveness. Various past business environment reforms were not
carried out properly. For example, the licensing policy intended to create a level playing field for
companies and encourage them to participate in the formal economy has not yet been applied. Private
sector development has been a priority for more than a decade, as expressed in past Five-Year Plans and
Economic Development Plans but these initiatives have not been effective; there have been few
opportunities for policy dialogue between the government and the private sector, and the continued
creation of SOEs in commercial sectors has crowded out private sector activities. An ambitious but much-
needed reform agenda must be supported by adequate implementation arrangements to give it full effect
and strong statistical capacity to inform evidence-based policy.
52. These constraints partly explain why potentially lucrative sectors have been underexploited.
Bhutan’s rich natural resources provide opportunities for growth, job creation, and poverty reduction
beyond hydropower that could help diversify the economy. Relaxing regulations that heavily favor
conservation over judicious utilization could promote growth and reduce poverty without compromising
the preservation of natural resources, the environment, and cultural values. Bhutan’s endowment of
natural assets has the potential to support economic growth and productive livelihoods. Using those
natural assets more effectively for forestry, tourism, and agriculture is not incompatible with achievement
of GNH, which places high value on conservation.
53. Properly managed, forests are a renewable resource that can make significant and sustainable
contributions to growth without compromising the environment. Proper management implies that
conservation and sustainable use are compatible—the latter does not have to come at the cost of the
former. About 72 percent of the country is covered by forest, far exceeding the constitutional mandate of
60 percent, and 33 percent of the forest area is suitable for sustainable management. However, only 6
percent is currently under commercial management. An annual increase of wood harvest from 0.39
million m³ to 1 million m³ could generate revenue of Nu 10 billion (US$149 million), which is almost half
of the revenue produced in 2016 by hydropower. This volume would still be below the Annual Allowable
Cut is of 1.2 million m³ established in 1991, which suggests that the production levels are sustainable. In
2017 forestry and wood-based industries contributed only 2.2 percent to GDP. Moreover, Bhutan has a
substantial trade deficit in wood and wood products. with imports six times higher than exports. There is
potential to develop forest-based enterprises without compromising Bhutan’s conservation agenda, but
30
exploring sustainable management options is deterred by overregulation and limited access to technology
and finance, and limited business capacity makes it hard for medium and small enterprises to operate in
the market.
54. The growth and job creation potential of tourism are limited by a current model designed to
prevent unregulated price competition and social and environmental disruption from large foreign
inflows. Since Bhutan opened to international tourists in 1974, it has seen a significant increase in the
number of tourist arrivals, which reached 274,000 in 2018, far above the 100,000 or so in 201254. Tourism
is the second largest economic sector, generating more than US$150 million annually in visitor spending,
and accounting for about 20 percent of non-hydro export income. Despite growing rapidly in recent years,
tourism in Bhutan ranked 78 out of 136 countries in the 2017 World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness report.55 Although arrivals of more lower-spending tourists from the region are not fully
consistent with the “high-value low volume” policy,56 it has helped smooth the bunching of arrivals; for
instance, visitors from India come to Bhutan to escape the summer heat. The current model requires all
foreign tourists to travel on fully-guided, all-inclusive, packaged tours designed and purchased from local
tour operators; it is not well aligned with global travel trends and demand for more customized and
immersive experiences. Because of the limited tourism-related offerings, less than 10 percent of Bhutan’s
arrivals are repeat visitors. This has led to a decline in the demand for pre-packaged sightseeing holidays,
the mainstay of vacations in Bhutan.
55. The continued growth in the size and spending power of the global middle class is an
unprecedented opportunity for Bhutan if connectivity can be improved and visitor demands can be met
as they evolve. Global spending on tourism and travel has been growing steadily for decades, most
recently driven by demand from the emerging middle class in developing countries. The number of
Chinese tourists visiting Bhutan went up from 500 in 2007 to 9,400 in 2015, though it slipped to 6,900 in
2018. Tourism is already a crucial backbone for Bhutan’s economy and its contribution to the economy,
especially in rural areas, could be much more significant. Its job creation potential could be particularly
valuable to youth and women because tourism tends to employ low-skilled labor and requires relatively
little investment. Promoting the growth of tourism and managing it sustainably requires easing
connectivity constraints, better meeting the evolving demands of visitors, and ensuring that growth is
sustainable: (a) Poor domestic connectivity has prevented the benefits of tourism from spreading more
widely; of Bhutan’s 20 districts, more than 70 percent of tourists visit only three, Paro, Thimphu, and
Punakha, which are all western. Having only one international airport as the main entry point and the
associated high travel cost limit tourist mobility. (b) The mystique of Bhutan, though still powerful, is
facing increased competition from other destinations, such as Myanmar, which are better attuned to
global travel trends and have a better value proposition. Bhutan could benefit from diversifying its tourism
offerings to respond to the country’s inherent advantages, such as educational and eco-tourism that
builds on Bhutan’s environmental, religious, and cultural heritage. (c) Tourist arrivals are concentrated in
spring and autumn; and about 90 percent of tourists come to Bhutan to visit religious and cultural sites
and festivals, leading to overcrowding. Better use of untapped carrying capacity across the country could
help maintain the long-term sustainability of assets.
56. Making agriculture more productive and promoting agribusiness will be critical to achieve
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Given the shortage of productive jobs, the dependence of the

and regional tourists, mainly from India and Bangladesh (202,000).

has fallen by 16.5 percent.
31
poor on agriculture, and their limited skills, poverty reduction and shared property cannot be achieved
unless agriculture becomes more productive. That means both increasing yields and diversifying from low-
to high-value crops. Most farming activities are subsistence-related; that is why the majority of
agricultural land is devoted to cereals, most of which are grown for household consumption rather than
sales or exports. This is particularly true for the poor, 80 percent of whom report farming mainly or solely
for family consumption. Subsistence farmers lack basic agricultural skills and the knowledge to improve
production. Raising the earnings of rural agricultural households will therefore require a broad-based shift
toward commercial farming or an increase in agricultural productivity through technology adoption,
training, and mentorship. However, the sector is facing increasing challenges to raising productivity: rural
to urban migration has led to loss of arable land and acute labor shortages, including a feminization of
agricultural labor; and mechanization and irrigation are minimal, compounding the issues of land and
labor scarcity. In Bhutan only about 8 percent of the land, about 277,000 acres, is cultivated arable land,
and only about 23 percent of it is currently irrigated. Expanded irrigation would enhance rice yields,
helping to improve food self-sufficiency—in 2017 Bhutan imported 90,000 MT of rice.
57. Within the larger agricultural value chain, agribusinesses need better access to finance and
markets.57 Agribusinesses, which are primarily microenterprises operating as sole proprietorships, suffer
from low access to finance and lack of skills.58 They are less likely to innovate than firms in other sectors
and make less use of ICT. Transportation costs are high because of poor road access. Exporting
agribusinesses tend to be poorly networked with external markets; most farmers and traders sell to
Bangladeshi or Indian merchants operating within Bhutan or at border markets rather than at the end
markets in destination countries. Supporting farmers to cultivate high-value crops, build agri-businesses,
and take advantage of proximity to large external markets could help raise their incomes.59 The benefits
to Bhutan’s rural population of developing high-value niche agricultural products can be realized through
investments in trade infrastructure, reform of subsidies, and better marketing. Ecotourism could leverage
denomination-of-origin schemes for both agri-products and manufactured goods. Local farmers,
agribusinesses, and producers could supply fresh produce, livestock, and manufactured goods to hotels,
thus creating a market for Bhutanese farmers and reducing the heavy reliance on imports of goods for
hotels.60 Farmers can pool together in cooperatives, leading to contract farming and possibly to links with
FDI. Increased urbanization and the development of competitive agricultural value chains connecting
urban hubs with smallholder rural producers could provide an opportunity for the rural population to gain
from spatial agglomeration as more profitable markets are created. Availability of land is a serious
constraint, but current policy and laws do not encourage small land holders to lease their lands to enable
consolidation, though the 2018 Land Lease Rules and Regulations are an important step in this direction.61
58. In addition to programs and subsidies for production, government support is also needed for
activities downstream in the value chain, such as aggregation, distribution, marketing, and export.
There is scope to better target current subsidies and to deploy more efficient instruments, such as
fertilizer vouchers. It may be useful to reorient public support to help de-risk agribusiness investments.
Moreover, much government support for marketing and value-addition comes through public agencies
that perform clearly private sector functions. These agencies may be creating distortions in the factor and
57 The difficult mountain terrain and the scattered population makes it commercially unviable for banks to open
branches in many rural areas. Mobile phone penetration is high, but mobile banking is nonexistent. Less than 20
percent of farmers have access to credit from financial institutions. The share of agriculture in total loans amounted
to just over 5 percent. A new commodity exchange has yet to develop by-laws, rules and regulations.
58 About 90 percent of agribusiness is microenterprises compared to 68 percent of other firms.

production markets that limit the growth of private agribusinesses. For example, Farm Shops were meant
to support the local rural economy but instead may be crowding out the few emerging rural enterprises
by competing with local shop owners and private input suppliers. Domestic agribusinesses could seize
opportunities arising from fast urbanization and growing urban demand for higher-value and processed
foods—the recent expansion in agribusinesses occurred in the Thimphu/Paro area, where labor and skills
are concentrated, and along the Indian border, where there are trade points.
(b) Strengthening macro-fiscal stability
59. Hydropower is expected to continue its significant role in Bhutan’s economy for the foreseeable
future, with continuing payoffs in growth, revenues and exports, but the associated macroeconomic
issues need to be managed. When Puna I and II come into operation by 2024/25, Bhutan’s
hydroelectricity generation capacity will double, with sizable impact on the economy through growth,
fiscal revenues, and export earnings. Massive hydropower investments generate large fluctuations in
aggregate demand, during both the construction and the commissioning phases, and introduce
considerable volatility in Bhutan’s small economy, where in 2017 GDP was an estimated US$2.5 billion.
For example, when the Tala hydropower project was commissioned in 2007, GDP growth spiked to 18
percent (figure 15). Delays in hydropower construction, production downtime for scheduled
maintenance, and less than normal rainfall can all reduce growth, exports, and government revenues. For
example, the 2017 delay in construction of Punatsangchhu I and II is estimated to have reduced GDP
growth by 3–4 percentage points.

come on stream, has kept Bhutan’s debt
62 To manage public debt, the government adopted the 2016 Debt Policy which sets ceilings for various debt
indicators; its approval was a major step forward in ensuring debt sustainability. The ceiling for non-hydro debt is
set at 35 percent of GDP as an average in a 5-year period. It also mandated formulation of a Medium-Term Debt
Management Strategy and regular analyses of debt sustainability. To support implementation of the debt policy, the
Debt Management Unit was formally transferred to the Department of Macroeconomic Affairs (DMEA), which
coordinates all policies relating to macroeconomics. The DMEA is responsible not only for ensuring that public debt
is sustainable but also that it is contracted at low cost and the risk is reasonable. It also recommends debt thresholds,
prepares the medium-term debt management strategy, and advises the government on on-lending, loan guarantees,
public private partnerships (PPPs), dividends, and divestment proposals.

61. Large revenues from hydropower generation have led to procyclical fiscal policies. Revenues
jump when a mega-hydropower project comes on line. For example, when Tala was commissioned in
2007, government revenues doubled and spending went up about 25 percent. Although the Public Finance
Act (2007) stipulates that recurrent expenditures must be met from internal resources, there is no limit
to recurrent spending when there is a spike in revenues. Spikes happen whenever a large hydropower
project comes on stream, generating a procyclical fiscal policy. Between 2005/06 and 2017/18
government spending quadrupled. However, because debt repayments begin one year after
commissioning, there is a need to lean against the procyclical effects of hydropower revenues. Historically,
commissioning of a hydropower project has produced a fiscal surplus for just one or two years before
deficits again emerge, demonstrating the need to ensure that spending is sustainable. Adopting fiscal rules
will help the government to keep fiscal policies countercyclical, which will both reduce fluctuations in
aggregate demand and help build fiscal buffers.
62. To consolidate its fiscal position, Bhutan
needs to strengthen domestic revenue

about 20 percent of GDP. Income tax, indirect

consolidating the tax base to collect revenue beyond the hydropower sector has not been easy.
63. A comprehensive review of tax policy and administration, followed by wide-ranging reforms,
would help mobilize more domestic revenues. Bhutan has not made any major tax policy or
administration reforms for a while. The plan to introduce GST in 2020 will be important for raising more
revenues. On tax administration, the 2016 Fiscal Incentive Act streamlined all previous incentives,
concessional rates, and relevant regulations. Yet in 2017 revenues foregone amounted to Nu. 2.8 billion,
equivalent to 10 percent of domestic revenues or 2 percent of GDP. A comprehensive review of tax
policies, including tax incentives, could help identify priority areas where reforms could help raise
domestic revenues. A comprehensive financing strategy could also cover better use of concessional
financing, development of the capital market, and identification of sources for innovative financing, such
as public-private partnerships (PPPs). The government adopted a PPP policy in 2016, managed by the
Public Private Partnership Agency (P3A), to finance infrastructure. However, there have been few actual
projects using PPPs.64
64. Public financial management (PFM) can be improved. Bhutan was the fifth country in the world
to receive the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) CHECK65 but further improvements
in PFM are needed. According to the 2016 PEFA report, the three areas that need reinforcement are
transparency; predictability and controls in budget administration; and accounting and reporting. The
government has updated its PFM strategy based on the PEFA. A cross-cutting theme was that enhanced
use of ICT can help make Bhutan’s PFM more efficient. Improvements in PFM will depend on reliable and
timely data on fiscal performance. Good accounting and reporting give government decision-makers and
other stakeholders accurate information on the use of public funds and on public assets and liabilities.
However, the shortage of accounting and auditing capacity in Bhutan complicates effective and efficient
use of public funds. Moreover, the budget has not yet been made sensitive to climate change and gender
equality. The annual budget call notification66 for the 2019/20 budget requested all budget agencies to
mainstream gender, environment, climate change, and disaster preparedness, but specific mechanisms
have yet to be established.67
65. Good coordination between fiscal and monetary policies requires appropriate institutional
arrangements and information-sharing. Some arrangements are already in place. For example, the
Secretaries of the Ministry of Finance and the Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) are members
of the RMA Board of Directors; and the Macroeconomic Fiscal Coordination Committee and the
Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Technical Committee have been functioning as a coordination
platform on macroeconomic issues. However, the shortage of timely data, particularly on fiscal
performance, is a barrier to effective coordination and execution of macroeconomic policies.
64 Even before the establishment of the framework, a PPP model was used for the Information Technology Park in
Thimphu in 2012 and an IFC- advised parking facility.
65 PEFA CHECK was instituted by the PEFA Secretariat to confirm the adequacy of the quality assurance processes
used in planning and implementing a PEFA assessment. The objective is to increase user confidence in the findings
of a PEFA assessment and confirm that the assessment contributes to a pool of reliable information on how a PFM
system performs.

(c) Investing in human capital and improving service delivery
66. Inequities in access to and the quality of services are a key challenge in all areas of service
delivery, although there have been broad-based improvements in access, especially at lower levels.
Efforts to improve service delivery need to continue as an investment in the productive capacity of the
population and to ensure equal opportunities for all. Although education is free, schooling is not
compulsory. That could be a detriment to the achievement of the poor and girls, especially in lower
secondary and beyond. Past efforts have focused on improving educational inputs but there has been
relatively little attention to the efficiency of the system or to learning outcomes. Despite nearly universal
primary enrollment, a high proportion of students complete the primary cycle without acquiring basic
literacy and numeracy skills.68 Results from the 2013 National Education Assessment for Class X showed
that just over half of the students achieved minimum competency in math and just less than half did so in
English. Recent pre-tests in Thimphu for the PISA-D (developing countries edition) found that, on average,
students scored below level 1 for reading and mathematical literacy and level 2 for scientific literacy (1 is
the lowest and 6 the highest achievement level).
67. Inequities in educational outcomes between areas and socioeconomic groups is a major
concern. The increase in primary enrollment has led to classroom overcrowding and pressure on teachers
and on other resources. The school privatization policy eased admission pressure in secondary schools
but widened area disparities because most private schools are in urban areas. The recent decision to waive
the cut-off for admission into class XI in public and private schools is expected to improve access to higher
secondary education. Schools in rural and remote areas, and those with higher proportions of students
from minority language backgrounds have difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified teachers. Major
reasons for students dropping out of school are geographic remoteness and poverty: the transition from
lower to middle secondary school often entails relocating, a cost many parents are unable to bear; for
example, 20 percent of secondary students in rural areas are in boarding schools. The lack of gender
sensitivity in school infrastructure is also a concern, especially provision of toilets and water.
68. Health services have been built around primary health care, but the quality of services and
socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes urgently require attention. Primary health care centers
(PHCs) cover most of the population, and because populations in catchment areas are low, health workers
can provide individualized services and if necessary provide house visits. With cancer cases on the rise,
many Bhutanese are referred for treatment abroad, as are those with other conditions that cannot be
treated domestically. Specialized care is limited to 27 referral hospitals. Bhutan’s health outcomes are
among the best in South Asia after Sri Lanka, but socioeconomic and spatial disparities are significant: 1
in 5 children are stunted, and stunting is correlated with poor access to safe drinking water and poor
infant feeding and caring practices, characteristics more likely to be found in poor households. Infant and
under-5 mortality is higher in the eastern region than in the western and central regions and under-5
mortality in rural areas is twice that in urban areas. There are also signs that health care, though free, is
underutilized: for example, 9 percent of women who had given birth in the previous 12 months received
no antenatal care, and 13 percent received no postnatal care. Only 26 percent of pregnant women
reported completing the recommended number of antenatal visits. Very few home births are attended
by a skilled health professional.

system. New health challenges are emerging
because of significant changes in lifestyle. Non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) are surging, and
the burden of communicable diseases is still
heavy.69 This pushes up the risk to the health of
Bhutanese in their productive years. Mental health
problems, especially alcoholism and suicides, are
on the rise, caused by sociocultural changes,
growing urbanization, migration, and
unemployment. Nearly 29 percent of adolescents
used a tobacco product in the previous month and
27 percent drank enough alcohol to be drunk.

accessible through Bhutan’s porous borders.
About 12 percent of adolescents currently use marijuana, among the highest rates in the region.
70. The health system is not well-equipped to cope with the emerging challenges. Although the
government continues to invest heavily in health infrastructure, with just 3.7 doctors (300 total) and 15.1
nurses per 10,000 population in 2017, there is an acute shortage of health professionals, particularly
specialists (figure 19). The shortage of specialists and sub-specialists is expected to persist. Retaining
health workers has been difficult, partly because of dissatisfaction with the pay scale. Other critical issues
are the lack of targeted nutrition interventions for low-income and marginalized populations and limited
geographic access to secondary care.
71. The quality of basic

sanitation) varies greatly
across Bhutan. Almost every
Bhutanese now has access to
electricity, but service quality
varies substantially: the share
of households that suffered a
power outage in the previous
7 days ranged from 11 percent
in Tsirang to 95 percent in
Dagana, with the average just
below 60 percent. Similarly,

37
share of households that have a 24-hour water supply varies between 51 and 83 percent. Finally, around
81 percent of households have a flush toilet at home, but in three districts, the percentage drops below
60 percent (figure 20).70 The lack of safe drinking water and basic sanitation likely contributes to stunting
(21.2 percent) among children under 5. Waterborne diseases, such as diarrhea and dysentery, are among
those with the highest incidence in Bhutan.71 While most service gaps are in rural areas, continued rural
to urban migration is increasing pressure on the quality of services in urban areas. For example, since 2005
Thimphu’s population has increased nearly 40 percent. Deficiencies in water supply, sanitation, and waste
management create challenges for livability and national competitiveness.
72. Together, these trends suggest that the spatial trade-offs in development need to be better
understood in order to inform policy prioritization and sequencing. Bhutan’s unique geography,
characterized by its rugged terrain of deep valleys and steep mountains, and an urbanization rate of 40
percent mean that more than half of its people are still dispersed across the countryside, often in very
small, very remote hamlets. Getting services to them is costly and inefficient. Reliance on evolving
technology and the use of alternate modes of delivery, such as mobile clinics, can help reduce the unit
cost of certain services but that does not change the need for serious decisions about which services can
be made available to whom and where. Proper policy prioritization and sequencing could help. Further
migration, possibly stimulated by consolidation of villages or households into small clusters, could help
improve service efficiency, quality, and equity of access. Building on the current Government to Citizen
Service initiative (G2C),72 ICT technologies like mobile, digital-based education and health services, could
address some of the trade-offs.73 Better management of public investment, e.g., in roads, would both help
address trade-offs and ensure sustainability by incorporating future operation and maintenance costs into
the budget.
73. Though private sector participation in service delivery could help improve its quality and
efficiency, the incentives must be carefully aligned. Private sector participation in health care is in its
early stages and limited to a few diagnostic centers, private retail shops in major towns, a small insurance
market, and off-hour services (WHO 2019). In education, as yet there are only a few private secondary
schools and one private college. While private sector participation could help improve service quality and
efficiency, the public sector could give more attention to providing services in remote areas where
profitability is too low to interest the private sector.
74. This raises the question of the extent to which provision of public services can remain free. In
2017 Bhutan’s expenditure on education was 6.7 percent of GDP, higher than in neighbors Bangladesh
(1.9 percent, 2016), India (3.8 percent, 2013), and Nepal (3.7 percent, 2015). However, a significant share
is funded by external grants and the projected funding gap in coming years is large. Total health
expenditure as a share of GDP is low, 3.6 percent as of 2014, and there is little access to individual health
insurance. The financing of service delivery has become more worrisome in the context of (a) shrinking
donor aid, which Bhutan has relied on heavily for infrastructure, health, and education investment; (b)
geographic remoteness, which lowers the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of investments, and (c) a
population rapidly shifting to urban areas, which lowers the return on investments in rural areas.
70 All figures are population-weighted estimates.

75. Finally, poverty has declined but vulnerability remains high, and a social protection system that
targets poverty reduction and offers an appropriate package of benefits could relieve the vulnerability.
A high share of the population is tightly clustered at the poverty line, and simple simulations suggest that
a 20 percent increase in the poverty line would almost double the poverty rate, from 12.1 to 20.1 percent.
A 50 percent increase would push the poverty rate up to 31.7 percent. Clearly, many Bhutanese
households are just a small shock away from falling back into poverty. Price and weather shocks lead to
volatile farm earnings, along with wildlife predation, which results in crop losses. Non-farm diversification
could help mitigate the impact of shocks, but almost 80 percent of poor households indicate that all their
working household members are engaged in agriculture—they have few other opportunities. The lack of
a formal safety net despite uninsured risks means that most farmers must deal with these shocks on their
own. Social assistance is limited to kidu, a royal prerogative, which by design is directed to relieving
hardships rather than alleviating poverty. Pensions are an entitlement reserved mainly for public sector
jobs. A full-fledged social protection system that targets poverty reduction, investment in human capital,
and building resilience at the household and community level can both enhance the livelihoods of
beneficiaries and give households more resilience against shocks. Such a system can also form the basis
for integrated interventions, provide links to other sectoral policies, and help address the imbalance
between public and private sector job benefits.
76. As decentralization continues, strengthening service delivery will depend heavily on better
intra-government coordination and greater subnational implementation capacity. The budget allocation
for delivery of public goods and services by districts and subdistricts is expected to double in the 12th FYP
period from the 11th FYP. The government has been drafting the National Decentralization Policy74 to (a)
establish a coherent policy and legal framework; (b) improve the operating environment for local
governments; and (c) lay the foundation for a Decentralization Implementation Plan. The policy clearly
states that devolution rather than delegation will be the main mode of decentralization.75 Thus it is of
utmost importance that subnational governments have adequate capacity to deliver services effectively.
Since provision of some important public services, such as water supply, can cut across several subnational
governments, close coordination will be critical to ensure that resources are used effectively.
(d) Enhancing disaster and climate resilience
77. Environmental sustainability is critical in Bhutan, where natural assets are central to growth
and access to jobs. The country is highly vulnerable to natural hazards like floods, landslides, earthquakes,
glacial lake outbursts, and droughts. Although there have been no major earthquakes recently, Bhutan is
at high risk because it is located in the seismically active Himalayan belt. Heavy seasonal monsoon rains
and glacial melt are the most common causes of flooding and landslides; and over 70 percent of
settlements and most infrastructure and fertile agricultural lands are located along the main drainage
basins, where floods are a constant threat.76 Recurrent flash floods and landslides cause major road-
related damage—a serious problem because roads are the only transport mode by land and a lifeline for
Bhutan, particularly for isolated communities. Unfortunately, although such damage occurs often, record-
74 https://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Draft-NATIONAL-DECENTRALIZATION-POLICY.pdf
75 The draft National Decentralization Policy defines (a) deconcentration as the process in which a central
organization transfers some responsibilities to a lower level unit within its jurisdiction; (b) delegation as
assignment of any responsibility or authority from a manager to a subordinate or from central to local
government; and (c) devolution as transfer of power to a lower level especially central to local governments.
76https://www.gfdrr.org/en/bhutan
39
keeping on damage and losses has been poor, so that the impact of natural disasters on the Bhutanese
economy and on the well-being of its people is underestimated. Extreme events, although less frequent,
further illustrate the risks from weather, water, and climate hazards; for instance, Cyclone Aila in 2009
cost US$17 million in damages, and extensive floods during the 2016 monsoon resulted in a loss of US$8.1
million from damage to critical infrastructure like roads and bridges, the water supply, and homes. With
most of the rivers confined in narrow gorges, landslides can form artificial dams that pose a great danger
to downstream settlers and hydropower plants due to outburst floods. The prolonged and extreme
droughts that have become common in some parts of Bhutan heighten the risk of forest fires, loss of
biodiversity, and crop loss. Urbanization has also changed the country’s risk profile as population and
assets are more heavily concentrated in towns and cities.
78. Weak infrastructure, dispersed settlement patterns, and a lack of information for evidence-
based planning exacerbate Bhutan’s vulnerability to natural disasters. Nearly 18 percent of the country’s
highways are in bad condition and the widening of another 17 percent has raised the risk of falling
boulders and landslides. There is little information specific to important economic sectors like agriculture
and hydropower, which intensifies the exposure and vulnerability of the economy to natural disasters and
climate change. Geospatially tagged information could facilitate multi-hazard risk assessments to inform
disaster-related planning and decision-making.
79. Climate change will have a profound impact on water resources, which need to be actively
managed to meet production and population needs. Over the long term, the rise in temperature is
projected to be much greater in the Himalayas than the world average, posing significant risks for Bhutan.
Changes in temperature and variations in rainfall may deeply affect the seasonal availability of water,
which would clearly affect hydropower and agriculture. As most current hydropower plants are run-off-
the-river, electricity production inevitably fluctuates with seasonal variations in river discharge. Irregular
rainfall leads to fluctuations in hydro production and therefore government revenues. Though plentiful in
the monsoon season, water is scarce in the winter months, and there is little capacity to store it between
seasons. It is estimated that more than 13,700 rural households have seasonal shortages of drinking
water. With climate change, local water stress may become even worse. Heavier rainfall could result in
more water runoff and less retention in the soil, making landslides more frequent. Erratic water supply
will impact irrigated agriculture and food production. Climate change will also affect forest conditions and
the health of Bhutan’s ecosystems. These climate-related vulnerabilities need to be managed proactively
so that water resources can meet production and population needs.
80. The poor and vulnerable are disproportionately affected by disasters because they have little
room to cope and must therefore deplete their assets or put their human capital at risk. A sound social
assistance system can deliver more efficient responses and help build household resilience. It could also
be scaled up to expedite efforts to recover from natural or economic shocks.
81. Activities directed to enhancing disaster and climate resilience have been hampered by the
fragmented implementation arrangements. Currently, almost all ministries and agencies are engaged in
this area, prominent among them are GNHC; the Ministries of Home and Cultural Affairs, Agriculture and
Forests, and Works and Human Settlements; the National Environmental Commission; and the National
Center for Hydrology and Meteorology. Although a coordination mechanism has been set up and key
policy documents like the Disaster Risk Management Strategy77 are in place, execution has been
suboptimal. In addition to the fragmented allocation of responsibilities, there is a lack of data available
and little sharing of information. With technical assistance from the World Bank, Bhutan is establishing
the Bhutan Climate Fund to monetize emission offsets from hydropower exports to India, which will be

invested in Bhutan’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Bhutan submitted its NDCs to the UN
Climate Change Secretariat in September 2015, reaffirming its commitment to remain carbon-neutral for
all time and to ensure that GHG emissions do not exceed the sink capacity of its forests. The net
sequestration capacity of Bhutan’s forests is 6.3 million tons of CO (tCO ) annually. Also, every year

2
strategies specified in the NDC are improving mass transport and reducing emissions from existing
vehicles, upgrading waste management infrastructure, promoting hydropower development with support
from climate market mechanisms, promoting climate-smart livestock and agricultural practices, and
promoting green industries and buildings.
(e) Addressing implementation gaps
82. While the overall legal, policy and development management framework is sound,
implementation gaps reduce the effectiveness of well-conceived policies. These gaps mainly stem from
(a) interpretations of policy that vary because of capacity constraints; (b) poor coordination within
government ministries and agencies; (c) lack of coordination with non-governmental stakeholders; (d lack
of evidence-based policy formulation; and (e) minimal M&E. While these are common challenges world-
wide, its small size means Bhutan is in a good position to address them.
83. Better coordination within government and with other stakeholders, addressing capacity
constraints, and keeping policy direction and implementation consistent could effectively further the
reform process and achieve impact on the ground. The Constitution provides for only 10 ministries and
autonomous agencies, such as the GNHC, the National Commission for Women and Children, and the
National Environmental Commission. Despite the small number of ministries and agencies, there is not
much coordination within the government, especially on cross-cutting issues. Decentralization is a
complication because it brings in different levels of government. For example, the division of
responsibilities and coordination for service delivery between the central and subnational governments
are not clear. Although the public sector is large relative to the size of the economy, technical capacity to
design, conduct, and monitor reforms is low. This is particularly relevant as more financial resources are
devolved to subnational institutions. Inadequate subnational capacity can undermine effective delivery
of services.78 Also, there are limited coordination with key stakeholders in policy formulation. For
example, the private sector claims suboptimal engagement in policy formulation in private sector
development policies.
84. Stronger statistical capacity, and more and better data, are critical to support evidence-based
policy formulation. Despite progress in advancing data standards and the wealth of statistics now being
produced, there remain areas with large gaps. For example, Bhutan’s education statistics are not
harmonized and there are no data on internationally comparable learning outcomes. Trends in the labor
market have been difficult to establish due to data quality issues, although since 2013 the data are more
reliable. The household surveys used to produce and analyze core socioeconomic indicators still do not
elicit certain critical information. For example, in a country where agriculture is the largest source of
livelihoods, the main household survey has no detailed agriculture module that could help to clarify which
rural households moved out of poverty, and why. Nor has there been a recent comprehensive survey of
Bhutanese health outcomes. There is no regular sample survey of businesses, though one could be

41
introduced with a sampling from the new Economic Census. Annual national accounts are published with
a 9–10-month lag. Information in the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) Final Report was not able to include the
most updated information. Although the 11th FYP set the target for exports in 2017–18, the most recent
data were from 201679. Bhutan’s score of 60 in the 2018 Statistics Capacity Index is lower than the South
Asia average of 76.80 Support for better statistical capacity, including more and better data and data
literacy, will be of utmost importance to advance evidence-based policy making, through, e.g., a more
systematic approach to building statistical capacity and initiatives supported by sufficient resources.
85. Better M&E can help ensure that policies are effective, improve program design, and provide
the evidence base for efficient allocation of public resources. Bhutan’s recent National Monitoring and
Evaluation Framework defines the scope of and assigns responsibilities for M&E activities.81 However, the
government has not yet applied it, not only because it lacks quality data, but also because of (a) the
disconnect between policy and M&E; (b) the lack of implementing capacity; and (c) underutilization of
available resources. In practice, few policies have been rigorously evaluated against the new M&E
guidelines; nor has the GNH screening tool been used for M&E.82 Development partners evaluate jointly
with the government most projects they fund, but the government rarely uses the outcomes to inform its
policies.
VI. Priorities for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
86. Building on hydropower development, Bhutan has made tremendous progress in expanding
access to services and reducing poverty. There have been remarkable improvements in access to
education, health, and basic services, but major challenges remain, and unless there is action, they may
prevent further progress in poverty reduction and sustainable shared prosperity.
87. The selection of priority areas for action was primarily guided by the recognition that achieving
the next level of development requires lifting economy-wide constraints on growth, poverty reduction
and job creation. While Bhutan has many achievements to be proud of, challenges remain in many areas.
As the SCD is intended to prioritize among the competing challenges, the main filter that was applied was
the impact of a particular measure on improving the prospects for growth, job creation and poverty
reduction.
88. Priorities were set based on a review of the evidence, consultations with stakeholders, and
team discussions. The starting point was the evidence and analysis presented in this report, which was
used to identify the main challenges for growth, inclusion, and sustainability. A first round of consultations
was then held with the government, development partners, civil society, and the private sector on the
main problems and opportunities identified.
89. Next, both external and internal consultations were conducted to understand the binding
constraints to achievement of the twin goals. Consultations were facilitated by a short presentation on
the themes of macroeconomic vulnerability, private sector development and job creation, and spatial
equity and sustainability. This helped define crucial questions related to Bhutan’s development
challenges. Several sessions were held with stakeholders that included the government, civil society,
development partners, and representatives from the private sector. Within the WBG three working

42
sessions were held with contributions from the entire country team; these sessions helped build a
consensus among different teams on Bhutan’s development priorities. This approach elicited substantive
inputs from a large country team while maintaining a collaborative process and a focus on the evidence
base for this report. A final round of consultation was conducted in October 2019.
90. There was wide agreement among stakeholders, both external and internal, on the binding
constraints for Bhutan to achieve the twin goals. While Bhutan has made tremendous progress in the
past, many critical development challenges remain, such as low connectivity, limited access to finance,
shortage of skilled labor, and regulatory gaps, all of which have been discussed extensively in this report.
A number of stakeholders also emphasized the need for Bhutan to build up sectors other than hydropower
and the importance of addressing implementation challenges. Highlights from the internal working
sessions were recognition of the importance of spatial trade-offs in development, their implications for
service delivery, and identification of sectors that could be sources of future growth and jobs. Data and
knowledge gaps were also identified.
91. As a result of this comprehensive process of diagnosis and prioritization process, this SCD has
identified five priority areas for Bhutan to achieve the twin goals. Within each, priorities are highlighted
that can support progress toward the goals. Priorities were identified based on their impact on the twin
goals and on their complementarities. The twin-goals filter assesses the impact of each area on reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition, resolving some constraints will have complementary
beneficial impacts on more than one domain (growth, inclusion, and sustainability). An example is
investment in connective infrastructure, which would have positive impacts on both private sector
development and service delivery. In setting priorities, the strength of the evidence base was assessed.
Table 5 presents the priorities and the time horizon for their implementation. Stakeholders reached broad
consensus on the priorities.

detailed reform options for SOEs to support private sector growth; (b) the implications of decentralization
for service delivery given limited subnational capacity; (c) the role of geography in service delivery and job
creation, and the implications for poverty reduction and shared prosperity; (d) the effectiveness and
efficiency of public expenditures; (e) alternative business models in the tourism sector, with possible
revision of the tariff structure and projections of yield and visitation levels; (f) how to change gender
norms and improve female labor force participation in economic activities and (g) mapping the potential
of high-value products in agriculture given requirements related to, e.g., quality, certification, and
volumes.

Appendix 1. Poverty in Bhutan
Poverty is measured as the share of the population that falls below a set poverty line. Poverty figures in
this report differ from the official poverty headcount rate for two reasons. First, there were
inconsistencies in how the official consumption aggregate was built over time, which can lead to estimates
that are not strictly comparable across years. Second, given issues with the consumption distribution,
instead of the national poverty line this report uses the World Bank’s US$3.20/day poverty line for lower-
middle-income countries (in 2011 PPP terms) as the cut-off line to define the poor. Despite these
methodological differences, the revised trend presented in this report is broadly similar to the one based
on the official consumption aggregate. More details on the calculation of the poverty indicators are
described in World Bank (2019) “Bhutan poverty, vulnerability and welfare: progress and challenges”.
47
Appendix 2. Hydropower in Bhutan
1. Bhutan has significant untapped hydropower potential. It is drained by the watershed of the
Brahmaputra river basin; the 2014 Power System Master Plan estimates its total hydropower potential at
30,000 MW. To date, the government has identified individual projects with projected installed capacity
of more than 25,000 MW, of which 2,326 MW has already been constructed and another 2,938 MW is
scheduled for completion by 2024/25 (table A2.1). The favorable conditions, steep mountains and plenty
of water resources, make the average cost of hydropower about US$1 million per MW, which is lower
than in most other countries.

2. Hydropower became significantly more important in the early 2000s. Hydropower contributes
to the economy mainly through three channels: GDP, the balance of payments, and government revenues.
Hydroelectricity production rose from 1,958 million units in 2002 to 7,266 million units in 2018. Other
than for domestic consumption, all hydroelectricity produced is exported to India. Hydroelectricity
exports went up from Nu 2.5 billion in 2002 to Nu 17.7 billion in 2018, when they accounted for 37 percent
of total exports (figure A2.1), in addition to the hydropower contributions to GDP and domestic revenues.
The non-manufacturing industry, which includes hydropower during and after construction, accounts for
more than a third of GDP. Hydropower contributes to domestic revenues through both tax revenues
(corporate tax from state-owned DGPC) and non-tax revenues (profit dividend from DGPC, royalty
revenues, and profit transfer from projects). Although its share in total revenues has fallen from over 40
percent in the early 2000s to 18 percent in recent years, the absolute value of hydropower revenues
increased from Nu 1.8 billion in 2002 to Nu 6.6 billion (figure A2.2).

3. However, the share in the economy in the economy has declined, while hydropower debt kept
increasing. Since Dagachhu (126 MW) was commissioned in 2015, no major hydropower projects have
gone on line; the planned completion of Punatsangchhu I and II has been postponed several times (table
A2.2). Hydropower projects are large complex infrastructure that require years of preparation and
planning. Several of Bhutan’s hydropower projects are larger than 1,000 MW, of which there are not many
in the world (neighboring India has only constructed four conventional hydropower plants above 1,000
MW, the largest being 1,500 MW). Bhutan’s hydropower projects have been complicated by unexpectedly
complex geology and other technical challenges that have caused significant cost-overruns and
construction delays.

4. Delay of hydropower projects has a severe impact on the economy. Any large hydropower
project has a sizable impact on the economy; for example, the construction cost of Punatsangchhu I is
estimated at US$1.5 billion, about 55 percent of projected GDP in 2017/18. A one-year delay can reduce
GDP growth by 3–4 percentage points, exports by US$250–300 million (about 50 percent of current
exports), and revenues by 0.5–1.0 percent of GDP (table A2.3).

from Nu 8 billion in 2002 to Nu 132 billion in 2018,
with its share in GDP rising from 34 to 76 percent
(figure A2.3). Hydropower projects are
implemented under an intergovernmental
agreement in which the Government of India
covers both the financial and construction risks of
the projects and buys surplus electricity at a price
reflecting cost plus a 15 percent net return.
Therefore, the 2018 World Bank-IMF joint debt
sustainability analysis confirmed that Bhutan’s risk

of debt distress remains moderate.
6. Diversification within the hydropower sector is critical. Hydropower financing and markets have
not yet been diversified. Bhutan’s hydropower development has been almost all financed by India through
grants and loans, and hydroelectricity is exported only to India. Financing from India for new hydropower
projects is becoming ever more difficult. In recent years, India has encouraged Bhutan to form joint
ventures (JVs) with Indian Central Public-Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) for financing and constructing new
hydropower projects. Kholongchhu Hydro, a JV with SJVN Ltd., would be one such example but the
concession agreement for it is still to be signed.
7. Diversification of markets has potential to tap the larger regional market. High economic growth
and suppressed demand in the region will likely result in a steep increase in power demand in coming
decades. Together with the general political preference for low carbon growth, this will create
opportunities for hydropower development as a reliable renewable power source—India alone is
estimating the need to install more than 300,000 MW of renewable energy capacity. On the other hand,
solar photo voltaic (PV) is driving down the cost for both small- and large-scale power generation to levels
close to Nu.3/kWh.83 Even if reliability and provision of peak power and ancillary services are among the
advantages of hydropower compared to solar PV, hydropower in South Asia will find it difficult to stay
competitive as costs and environmental and social requirements all go up. Furthermore, India has just put
83 Current export tariffs for existing plants under long-term PPAs are: Chukha – Nu 2.55/kWh, Tala and Kurichhu –
Nu 2.12 /kWh. Power from Dagachhu, which is traded on the open market through Tata Power, has currently a
tariff of Nu 2.96 /kWh.

in place a new structure for cross-border trade in electricity, key aspects of which have raised concerns
(which India is understood to be addressing) in other South Asian countries about how it will apply. This
has added to the uncertainty on access to markets and conditions for hydropower exports from Bhutan.
8. Hydropower could contribute more to job creation. Construction of large hydropower projects
normally takes 4–6 years and at peak involves up to 10,000 workers. It requires vast amounts of materials
like cement and steel and a considerable amount of equipment for excavation, tunneling, etc. Normally
25–30 percent of the cost is related to electro-mechanical and hydro-mechanical equipment that has to
be imported, and about 65–70 percent of the cost is related to civil works. About 5–10 percent of the
costs are for project management, engineering design. and supervision. Hydropower creates few jobs
directly. Although construction requires thousands of workers, these are normally unskilled, and large
international contractors often import them. However, higher-level jobs are created in project
management, engineering, and operations. The DGPC has about 1,700 employees, many of them with
higher education. Another 2,100 are employed on active projects in project management and engineering.
With commissioning of mega-hydropower projects, there is potential to directly create a few more
thousand jobs, and more jobs indirectly for construction and services. DGPC has successfully built up a
Bhutanese cadre of hydropower experts; staff at the Chukha and Tala plants, mainly Indian at first, have
now been replaced with Bhutanese employees.
9. However, as more hydropower projects are commissioned, operational issues need more
attention. In the short term, variations in rainfall and snowmelt from year to year lead to fluctuations in
production. Although hydropower plants are technically designed to be sustainable and withstand major
floods, glacial outbursts, and earthquakes, extreme events may temporarily disrupt operations for one or
more projects; and some hydropower plants are located on the same river. If this occurs for major
schemes, such as Tala Hydropower Project, which today produces 60 percent of the power, government
revenues may also be disrupted. This calls for development and implementation of a regulatory
framework for maintenance, dam safety, regulations and inspections of hydropower plants to ensure that
they are resilient to extreme events.
10. The government in 2017 set up a high-level committee to review future hydropower
development plans. Although the Hydropower Committee has already completed its recommendations,
they have not been made public; it has been decided that after the elections the new government should
review the recommendations and decide on next steps. Informally, it is understood that the committee
has recommended completing construction of current projects and putting any new plans on hold. This
may have significant implications for Bhutan; if adoption of battery storage accelerates over the next
decade or so, hydro may become irrelevant. Any new developments should in any case be preceded by
detailed technical studies, update of the Power Sector Master Plan 2004, and basin level studies84 in order
to define an informed roadmap for hydropower development.
84 A potential cumulative impact assessment for Kuri-Gongri basin has just been completed, but similar
assessments are needed for other basins.
