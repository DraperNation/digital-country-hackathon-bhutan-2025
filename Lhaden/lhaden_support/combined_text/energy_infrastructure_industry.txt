Annex 1 to Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2024–2028
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH ASSESSMENT
1. This assessment reviews Bhutan’s performance with respect to key socioeconomic
indicators, impediments to inclusive and sustainable growth and their potential solutions, and the
development priorities and programs emphasized in Bhutan’s Thirteenth Five Year Plan, 2024–
2029.1 It draws on various sector and thematic assessments, the recommendations of the final
review of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2019–2023
and its validation report prepared by the Independent Evaluation Department,2 and consultations
with government, development partners, and civil society. This assessment informs the CPS
2024–2028 for Bhutan.3
A. Recent Growth, Poverty, Inequality, and Other Development Dynamics
2. Economic growth, 2000–2019. Bhutan’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 8% on
average during 2000–2009 (Figure 1), supported by the commissioning of the 60 megawatt (MW)
Kurichhu powerplant in 2002 and the 1,020 MW Tala powerplant in 2007; strong manufacturing
growth led by power-intensive, mineral-based industries including ferrosilicon, cement, and
ceramics; and the opening of the economy as a result of economic and policy reforms.4
Hydropower, manufacturing, construction, financial services, and real estate contributed about
60% of the growth during this period. Bhutan’s average annual GDP growth rate declined to 6%
during 2010–2019 as a result of a slowdown in manufacturing, the lack of effective reforms to
reduce regulatory burdens on the private sector, growing dominance of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), and the fact that only one hydropower plant (the 720 MW Mangdechhu powerplant) was
commissioned during this period, toward the end of 2019. There was a shift in sector growth:
Bhutan’s fasting growing sectors during 2000–2009 were utilities (electricity, gas, and water);
hotels and restaurants; trade; and manufacturing. This shifted during 2010–2019, with mining and
quarrying; hotels and restaurants; wholesale and retail trade; and finance, insurance, and real
estate becoming the fastest growing sectors (Figure 2). The slowdown in manufacturing, the large
public sector, heavy dependence on hydropower, a weak private sector, and limited economic
diversification are matters of concern. GDP per capita, measured in current United States (US)
dollars tripled from $723 in 2000 to $2,194 in 2010, but grew by just 1.7 times to $3,688 in 2019.5
3. Economic growth, 2020–2025. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic dealt a
severe blow to Bhutan’s economy, which had been slowing since 2010. Through a combination
of measures—including lockdowns, strict travel and quarantine requirements, and high vaccine
coverage of around 95%—the government controlled the spread of infection effectively, with just
21 COVID-19 deaths in Bhutan. However, the prolonged restrictions, the border closure with India,
and the ban on tourism caused Bhutan’s economy to contract by 10.2% in 2020. The decline was
blunted by the commissioning of the Mangdechhu hydropower plant in late 2019, which boosted
government revenue. Fiscal and monetary stimulus measures helped buffer small businesses
and vulnerable groups from the economic slowdown and job losses. Bhutan’s economy grew by
4.4% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022, and is projected to grow by 4.0% in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024.

4. Slow structural transformation. Changes in Bhutan’s economic structure and labor
force have been slow (Figures 3a and 3b). As of the third quarter of 2023, 43.5% of the labor force
was engaged in the low-productivity primary sector, which accounts for only 13% of GDP. The
secondary sector as a percentage of GDP has declined from close to 46.9% in 2009 to 31% in
2023, while its share in employment has been stagnant at around 14%, indicating a decline in
productivity. Within the secondary sector, the share of construction grew from 13% to 44% while
that of manufacturing fell from 87% to 56% over the period. About 95% of enterprises in Bhutan
are cottage and small-scale industries.7 They employ about 99,228 workers, but most use low
productivity techniques, are constrained by a lack of access to finance, and have weak prospects
for growth.8 The share of the tertiary sector relative to GDP and employment has risen since
2016.9 However, within the tertiary sector, the share of information and communication
technology, and financial and real estate services in total service employment fell from 15% to 5%
during 2010–2021, while that of traditional services (trade and transport) rose from 85% to 95%.
It is critical for the government to enable the private sector, strengthen the manufacturing and
tertiary sectors by simplifying industrial licensing requirements and foreign direct investment (FDI)
rules, direct credit to the more productive sectors and enterprises (para. 11, and Figures 8 and
9), restructure inefficient SOEs that are crowding out private businesses, and invest in technical
and vocational education and training (TVET) reforms to enable workers to transition from low to
higher productivity sectors and sub-sectors.
5. High youth unemployment and brain drain. Bhutan’s unemployment rate increased
from 2.7% in 2019 to 5.9% in 2022, and then declined to 3.5% in 2023. However, youth
unemployment reached an alarming 28.6% in 2022 in response to a sharp slowdown in economic
activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of many overseas Bhutanese
workers. Most have resumed their work overseas, leading to a drop in youth unemployment to
15.9% in 2023. However, emigration of Bhutanese youth and professionals, which began in 2014,
has increased sharply following the pandemic because of the continuing lack of adequate job
opportunities. During 2021–2023, 9,352 civil servants resigned, and several hundred availed of
long leave.10 Former civil servants, students, doctors and health workers, teachers, engineers,
and other professionals account for the majority of those who are migrating. About 64,000
Bhutanese are estimated to be overseas, suggesting that around 9% of Bhutanese have left over
the past few years.11 This brain drain is destabilizing for a small country such as Bhutan. Gender
disparities in labor force participation and employment are also worsening over time (para. 15).
6. Growing current account imbalance. Because of its small size, landlocked location, and
narrow economic base, Bhutan relies heavily on imports of essential goods including petroleum,
machine parts, consumer goods, computers, rice, and ferrous products. With the exception of
hydropower exports to India, most Bhutanese exports (ferrosilicon, gypsum, dolomite, cement,
boulders, and pebbles) have low value addition and are extractive. Ferroalloys accounted for over
7 Cottage and small-scale industries include establishments with 19 or fewer workers. As of 2022, 42% of such
establishments were in wholesale or retail trade, 31% in accommodation and food services, and 11% in
manufacturing. The remainder were in administrative services, entertainment, and construction.

dwellings, professional administrative and support services, public administration and defense, education, human
health and social work health, and entertainment, recreation, and other services.

46% of non-hydro export value in 2023. About 80% of imports come from India and 90% of
exports—mostly hydropower sales—are to India. The heavy dependence on imports, low value-
added exports, and poor terms of trade have resulted in a current account deficit (Figure 4), which
averaged 19.8% of GDP during 2016 to 2019, but worsened to 31.2% of GDP in 2022 because
of increases in the price of oil and some food items, depreciation of the Indian rupee and ngultrum
(which are pegged) relative to the US dollar, and large imports of bitcoin mining equipment. The
current account deficit is expected to narrow to 25.2% of GDP in 2023 because of reduced imports
of bitcoin mining equipment.

7. Shortage of convertible currency reserves. Gross international reserves (mainly Indian
rupees and US dollars) rose by 14.27% during 2016–2019, from $1,062.0 million to $1,214 million,
but reserves declined from $1,213.6 million to $607.0 million during 2019–2023 (Figure 5). This
is below the constitutionally mandated reserve requirement of 12 months of essential imports, or
about $670.0 million. Higher food and fuel prices resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and the huge increase in imports of bitcoin mining equipment (valued at about $539 million from
July 2021 to June 2023) have contributed to this sharp decline in foreign exchange.12 Foreign
exchange inflows have been low because of the weak recovery of the tourism sector (para. 24).
To slow the outflow of reserves, the government has periodically enforced bans on nonessential
imports including automobiles, machine parts, and some food items. Hydropower exports
declined from $303 million in 2021 to $217 million in 2023 as a result of inadequate rain and a
sharp rise in domestic power consumption, caused mainly by the increase in power consumed by
bitcoin mining.13 Because the bulk of Bhutan’s imports are denominated in Indian rupees, a
decline in rupee earnings from hydropower exports is a cause for concern. To promote
remittances in the face of the convertible currency reserve shortage, the Royal Monetary Authority
raised its remittance incentive from 2% to 10% from June 2023 to February 2024. Data are
currently unavailable to assess the extent to which this has encouraged remittances.

8. Rising inflation. Consumer prices in Bhutan have closely tracked price movements in
India because of the currency peg between the ngultrum and Indian rupee, and the close trade
relationship between the two countries. Inflation averaged 3.6% during 2015–2019, but rose to
6.2% year-on-year during 2020–2022 as a result of pandemic-related travel restrictions, the
border closure, and global supply chain disruptions.14 Overall inflation was 4.2% in 2023. Food
price inflation accelerated to 7.2% during 2020–2022 in response to border closures, compared
with 4.5% from 2015 to 2019, and slowed to 4.0% in 2023. However, periodic episodes of high
food inflation cause hardship for poor households and underscore the need for Bhutan to work
toward food security by increasing production of basic food items.15

9. Weak fiscal performance. Bhutan’s fiscal balance has deteriorated since the pandemic.
The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP was 4.6% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018, and 1.1% in 2019.
The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 resulted in a collapse in economic activities, with sharp
declines in tax and nontax revenue. Government spending—in the form of COVID-19 relief,
rescheduling of loan repayments, and economic stimulus—increased, causing the fiscal deficit to
widen to 7% of GDP in 2022. The tax-to-GDP ratio declined from 15.7% in 2018 to 12.2% in 2020,
and 12.0% in 2022. More needs to be done to reform tax policy and modernize tax administration
to raise domestic revenue. It is estimated that if Bhutan transitions to a goods and services tax
and digitizes its tax administration, additional taxes of around 1.1% of GDP can be mobilized.16
10. Growing debt levels. Total public debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 94% in fiscal year
(FY) 2019 (ended 30 June 2019) to 136.8% in FY2023. The external debt-to-GDP ratio was
120.6%, or 89.1% of total public debt in FY2023. About 83% of Bhutan’s external debt is because
of hydropower projects (Figures 6 and 7). The Government of India is the lender for these projects
and the main buyer of the power that is generated. This debt is self-liquidating because it is paid

back after the hydropower projects are commissioned and the sale of power to India begins. There
is no exchange rate risk because the debt is denominated in Indian rupees. Hence, the
International Monetary Fund’s Article IV mission of July 2022 assessed the risk of public debt
distress as moderate (footnote 16). Non-hydro external debt is at the constitutionally mandated
maximum of 35% of GDP. Domestic debt rose from 4.7% of GDP in FY2019 to 16.2% of GDP in
FY2023. Over 95% of domestic debt is government bonds and treasury bills, with the rest being
corporate debt.17
11. Weak finance sector. Bhutan’s five banks held total deposits equivalent to 83.1% of GDP
in November 2023.18 Of these, the Bank of Bhutan, Bhutan National Bank, and the Bhutan
Development Bank are majority public sector banks, while the Tashi Bank and Druk Punjab
National Bank are private banks. Public sector banks together accounted for 81% of the total
banking sector’s credit to the economy and 80% of total banking sector assets in October 2023.19
All the banks, to varying degrees, saw their financial health deteriorate after the pandemic. The
risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of banks remained above the 12.5% minimum, improving
from 12.8% in September 2019 to 14.7% as of September 2022. Asset quality indicators have
similarly improved, with the gross nonperforming loan ratio improving from 18.4% in September
2019 to 7.8% in September 2022. However, these figures should be interpreted with caution, as
they are supported by a range of pandemic relief measures, including loan repayment deferments
that have been extended for an additional year to June 2024 (for all sectors). Credit flows are
largely directed to tourism (loans for hotels and tourism operators) and housing (Figure 8), leaving
limited financing available for other productive activities and enterprises (Figure 9). Nominal
private credit growth was only 4% during 2018–2022. Market capitalization of the 19 companies
listed with the Royal Security Exchange Board increased by 134% in nominal terms, from $31.7
million in 2017 to $74.4 million in 2023. The debt market has expanded. In 2023, there were nine
outstanding bonds, valued at $39.9 million, which is a near tripling of the nominal value of bonds
since 2017.

12. Progress in financial inclusion. Bhutan has made good progress in modernizing its
payments system and increasing financial inclusion. About 94% of households have a bank
account and 87% of households use a bank account to save money.20 These banked rates are
high, given Bhutan’s income level. The use of banking apps (through Bank of Bhutan’s mBOB
and Bhutan National Bank’s mPAY) increased during the pandemic as exchange of cash was
discouraged and vendors moved to mobile payments. Only 46% of households have an active
loan, which is higher than the 2017 figure of 40%. However, the rural–urban gap in bank loans
increased from 9 percentage points in 2017 to 12 percentage points in 2022. Most loans (74%)
are from banks, and less than 1% of the population has ever received a loan from a microfinance
institution. Low adult literacy (71% in 2021) remains a constraint on financial inclusion,
disproportionately affecting rural residents.21
13. Progress in reducing poverty. Bhutan’s strong growth during 2000–2009 enabled it to
achieve its poverty reduction target (i.e., to reduce the extreme poverty rate by 50%) set under
the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule. Although growth slowed during 2010–
2019 (and even more during the pandemic), evidence indicates that progress in reducing extreme
poverty is being maintained. Headcount poverty based on the $2.15 international poverty line
(2017 purchasing power parity) fell from 1.5% in 2017 to an estimated 0.6% in 2022. The national
poverty line was revised substantially upward in 2022, meaning the rate in 2017 (8.2%) cannot
be compared with that in 2022 (12.4%) (Figure 10). The 2022 rural poverty rate is 17.5% as
compared to the urban poverty rate of 4.2%. Analysis of microdata suggests that the national

poverty rate fell from 2017 to 2022 in line with the rate of reduction from 2012 to 2017, despite
the economic effects of the pandemic. This is confirmed by the reported rate of food insufficiency,
which fell from 6.2% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2022. The multidimensional poverty index also declined
from 5.8% to 2.1% over the same period, as delivery of basic services improved. While informal
safety nets are believed to be strong, there are few formal mechanisms, especially for vulnerable
groups such as persons with disabilities, injuries, and illnesses, who accounted for 9% of the
unemployed in 2022. Persons with disabilities mostly live in rural areas (80%).

14. Improvement in human development and availability of basic services. Bhutan’s
Constitution mandates provision of free basic health services and free education up to the 10th
grade, and Bhutan has consequently made significant progress in terms of education and health
coverage. Primary school enrolment is nearly universal. The gross secondary school enrollment
rate in 2022 was 95% for girls and 82% for boys. Participation in college has doubled since 2013,
and there is broad gender equality. However, only 1 in 4 persons with disabilities is literate or had
attended formal education in 2021,22 while for all demographic groups, the link between education
and employment outcomes is weak, as reflected in the very high rate of youth unemployment
(para. 5). Quality of education as measured by learning-adjusted years of schooling puts Bhutan
second lowest in South Asia, at 6.3.23 During 2017–2022, life expectancy at birth rose from 70.8
years to 71.8 years and expected years of schooling rose from 12.9 to 13.2, while completed
years of schooling rose from 3.7 to 5.2. Infant and maternal mortality rates improved over the
same period (Figure 11). Bhutan’s ranking on the Human Development Index improved from
125th out of 191 economies in 2017 to 134th in 2022, but it was the second-lowest score of any
South Asian country on the Human Capital Index in 2020, with a score of 0.48, and has been in

the “medium human development” category since 2017.24 As of 2021, all households had access
to electricity, 97% had access to drinking water, and 77% had access to basic sanitation.
15. Improvement in gender equality. Gender-based differences in life expectancy and
education in Bhutan are marginal, but some structural and cultural norms hinder the full realization
of gender equality and women's empowerment. School enrolment of girls is high (para. 14), and
Bhutan’s maternal mortality (60 per 100,000 live births in 2020) is below that in Bangladesh, India,
and Nepal. However, because the UN’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey was last conducted in
2010, more recent information on internationally comparable indicators pertaining to mothers and
children (e.g., stunting and vaccination rates) is unavailable. Bhutan’s Gender Development Index
improved from 0.93 in 2017 to 0.96 in 2021, but its performance on the Global Gender Gap Index
(which incorporates more social indicators) has stalled largely due to the lack of progress in
increasing female representation in Parliament.25 The gender gap in the unemployment rate for
2023 is large in relative terms (7.9% for women versus 4.4% for men), while the labor force
participation rate gap is large in absolute terms (56.8% for women versus 72.4% for men). In
2021, around 58% of the workers in the agriculture sector were women. The poverty rate (based
on the national poverty line) for households headed by women (12.5%) is slightly higher than the
rate for households headed by men (12.3%). About 60% of recent TVET graduates are male.
16. Progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. As of 2023, Bhutan is
faring well on about 58% (72 indicators) of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators
for which sufficient data are available. It is on track to achieving SDG1 (no poverty), SDG3 (good
health and well-being), SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG7 (affordable and clean
energy). This is closely followed by good performance with respect to SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG4
(quality education), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG15 (life on land).
Bhutan has experienced regressing trends in more than half of measured indicators with respect
to advancement in SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (industry, innovation, and
infrastructure), and SDG13 (climate action). The assessment of some SDGs has been affected
by data gaps.26
17. Rise in economic inequality. While progress against poverty has been strong, including
in rural areas, overall income inequality has widened. The income-based Gini coefficient
increased from 0.55 in 2007 to 0.60 in 2022. There is a large rural–urban dichotomy in terms of
inequality and vulnerability, with the rural poverty rate nearly four times higher than the urban
poverty rate. During 2017–2022, the urban population rose from 40% to 44% of the total
population. Households in rural areas have difficulty in accessing essential services; their travel
time to hospitals and banks is about 4 times longer than that for urban households, while the
average rural household is a 45-minute walk away the nearest paved road, compared to 8 minutes
for the average urban household.27
18. Regional disparities. Bhutan has 20 dzongkhags (districts). Thimphu accounts for 19.0%
of the total population, Chhukha for 9.5%, and Samtse for 8.6% (Table 1). About half of Bhutan’s
poor live in the southern and eastern dzongkhags of Chukha, Mongar, Samtse, Samdrup

Jongkhar, Trashigang, and Zhemgang. The quality and coverage of roads, schools, and health
facilities in these areas remain below par. Close to 85% of tourist inflows are to Paro, Punakha,
and Thimphu, and many Bhutanese from more rural, poorer, and under-served dzongkhags have
migrated to cities in search of employment. Infrastructure investment should target Bhutan’s
underserved dzongkhags to ensure growth is broad-based and inclusive.
19. Vulnerability to climate change and environmental issues. Bhutan’s fragile geological
features and steep topography make it highly susceptible to geophysical hazards and the impacts
of climate change. 28 Rising global temperature and precipitation variability could lead to extreme
weather events, with impacts that include forest fires, floods (including glacial lake outburst
floods), and landslides. Projections of weather and climate anomalies in Bhutan show that current
trends will likely continue,29 and are expected to result in more frequent and severe hazardous
events that will pose greater threats to communities, agricultural lands, and infrastructure, and
endanger Bhutan’s forests and biodiversity.30

Under the 13th 5-year plan (for 2024–2029) (footnote 1) and the long-term growth strategy for
2024 to 2034, the government has set ambitious growth targets, aiming to increase Bhutan’s GDP
from around $3 billion in 2024 to $5 billion in 2029, and to $10 billion by 2034, and raise its current
per capita income of around $3,879 to more than $12,000 by 2034. This will require an average
annual growth rate of around 13% over 10 years. By 2027, the government wants to create full
employment by generating an adequate number of quality jobs, and by 2030, it plans to quadruple
the income of the bottom 40% of Bhutan’s population. Details on how these targets will be
achieved and various programs financed are not currently available. However, tackling the
challenges discussed below will be important if Bhutan is to achieve its goals and targets.
21. Narrow economic base and dominance of hydropower. Bhutan is a small, hilly, and
landlocked country, with a narrow economic base. Hydropower projects, both during construction
and after commissioning, have traditionally been the main driver of Bhutan’s economy. During
2011–2020, yearly earnings from hydropower exports to India averaged 10% of GDP, 33% of
government revenue, and 35% of exports. However, the hydropower sector, given its capital-
intensive nature, accounts for only around 1% of direct employment. GDP growth spikes in years
when new hydropower plants are commissioned and begin selling power to India. Bhutan’s
hydropower production capacity increased from 1,660 MW in 2015 to 2,326 MW by 2019, and is
expected to increase to 3,473 MW by the end of 2024 with the commissioning of the 118-MW
Nikachhu hydropower project (partly funded by ADB), and the 1,020-MW Punatsangchhu II
project (funded by the Government of India). Bhutan plans to further increase hydropower
capacity and is seeking financiers for large projects such as the Dorjilung (1,125 MW) and
Kholongchhu (600 MW) plants. While the increased hydropower will help Bhutan increase power
sales to India, and support bitcoin mining, it is necessary to use part of the added generation
capacity to provide cheap and reliable power to support the diversification of Bhutan’s private
enterprises and make growth more inclusive.
22. Dominance of state-owned enterprises. Bhutan currently has 13 “socially oriented”
SOEs under the Ministry of Finance (including Druk Holding and Investments), and 22
“commercially oriented” SOEs under Druk Holding and Investments, for a total of 35 SOEs. They
operate across almost all sectors including agriculture, energy, manufacturing, real estate,
wholesale and retail trade, banking, insurance, telecommunication, airline, manufacturing, and
mining. Representatives of Bhutan’s private sector often raise concerns that some SOEs (e.g.,
those involved in agriculture, livestock, media, and housing) crowd out the private sector through
their access to government subsidies and preferential treatment in terms of tax incentives and
procurement. The mandates of most SOEs have expanded beyond their original core social
objectives, which has resulted in mismanagement and higher losses. In 2021, SOEs generated
revenue of $729.5 million—about 30% of GDP—an increase of 16% over 2020. In 2021, the five
best-performing SOEs generated a profit of $140.8 million while the five worst-performing
generated a loss of $24.0 million.32 The SOEs accounted for 11,000 jobs (3.5% of total national
employment) in 2021.33 Their assets equaled 207.0% of GDP in 2021, with the government’s
share equal to about 92.0% of GDP. Ten SOEs alone account for 95% of SOE assets. From
FY2017 to FY2021, about $125 million (at an exchange rate of $1 = Nu78) was disbursed in the
form of subsidies to SOEs under the Ministry of Finance. Considering the small size of Bhutan’s

12
economy and population, and its growing fiscal stress, a review and reassessment of the rationale
and performance of SOEs is needed.
23. Absence of an enabling environment for the private sector. Economic diversification
has been constrained by Bhutan’s location, small market, and the absence of an enabling policy
and regulatory environment for the private sector. While the government has enacted several
reforms to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) and public–private partnerships, develop the
financial sector, and encourage competition, reform implementation has not been effective and
the desired results have not been attained.34 FDI (excluding in the hydropower sector) remains
very low, falling from 0.13% of GDP in 2019 to an average of 0.04% of GDP for 2020–2022. The
private sector continues to be heavily regulated. Frequent policy changes (para. 24) create
uncertainty for the private sector. Despite government pronouncements seeking to boost FDI,
some requirements imposed on foreign ventures serve to make Bhutan less attractive. Barriers
include the complex approval process and lack of a single window for investors, equity restrictions
that make it difficult to find local partners, minimum investment restrictions, and difficulties in
obtaining and renewing visas for investors. According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business
2019, Bhutan ranked 81st out of 190 economies, behind India, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan.35 The
three most problematic areas identified were difficulties in starting a business, protecting minority
investors, and resolving insolvency. Bhutan’s banks are burdened by a high nonperforming loan
rate. They are also unable to meet the financing needs of entrepreneurs and enterprises. The
private sector has to compete with the SOEs for credit, raw material, labor, and market share. In
2022, only 30% of employed individuals worked for a private business. In the absence of quality
jobs generated by the private sector, economic growth in Bhutan will not be equitable. More needs
to be done to promote trade, update the insolvency law, harmonize customs procedures and
certification requirements, and move to a single window clearance system.
24. Weak public sector management. Bhutan scores high on five out of six governance
indicators (control of corruption, rule of law, political stability, accountability, and government
effectiveness).36 However, it continues to underperform in terms of regulatory quality (i.e., the
ability of the government to provide sound policies and regulations to promote private sector
development), which creates disincentives for the private sector, discourages FDI, and raises the
cost of doing business. For example, as part of its renewed focus on “high value and low volume
tourism,” the government levied $200 per person per day as sustainable development fees on
non-Indian tourists and around $15 per person per day on Indian tourists with effect from July
2022. Druk Air and Bhutan Airlines, the two airlines allowed to operate in Bhutan, nearly doubled
the fares for non-Bhutanese travelers. These decisions adversely affected the post-pandemic
recovery of hotels, restaurants, airlines, tour operators, and businesses with links to the tourism
sector, which were devastated during the pandemic. In 2023, about 103,000 tourists visited
Bhutan, equal to about 33% of the 315,600 tourists who visited in 2019. To revive the tourism
sector and related services, the government has now offered a 50% discount on the sustainable
development fee for non-Indian tourists with effect from 1 September 2023. This will be in place
until 31 August 2027. With this reduction, the number of tourists should increase. Between July
2022 and July 2023, the sustainable development fee of $200 per person per day was also levied
on potential foreign investors (non-Indians) and $15 per person per day on potential Indian
investors if they came to Bhutan to prospect for business opportunities. This was a disincentive
for foreign investors. Information is not available about the government’s growing investments in

bitcoin mining since 2020, which has resulted in a sharp decline in foreign dollar reserves and the
amount of power Bhutan sells to India. Since 2022, Bhutan has had to import power from India’s
Energy Exchange in winter (mainly because of the increase in power consumption due to bitcoin
mining) at higher unit rates than at which it sells power to India.
25. Infrastructure gaps and vulnerability to climate change and disasters. While
Bhutan’s road infrastructure has expanded over the years, several dzongkhags in the north, east,
and south of the country still lack adequate connectivity. Bhutanese travelling west to east along
its southern border must drive through the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam, which adds
to travel time and costs.37 With the increase in urbanization, the government needs to invest more
in improving urban infrastructure and increasing the supply of affordable housing. Only one-third
of Bhutan’s farmland land is irrigated. Public sector investment in irrigation and strengthening of
integrated water resources management will be essential to ensure climate-smart agriculture.
Given its fragile Himalayan ecology, Bhutan is vulnerable to climate change and disasters (e.g.,
landslides, glacial lake outburst floods, and floods). This makes the design, execution, and
maintenance of public infrastructure more complex and expensive. Climate volatility will
disproportionately affect farmers and other vulnerable groups. Changes in rainfall patterns will
have adverse consequences for Bhutan’s hydropower generation and balance of payments. The
adverse economic impact of flooding on human health and livelihoods could equal 4% of GDP by
the 2030s unless appropriate adaptive measures are taken.38 Better management of river basins
will be critical. The capacity of Bhutan’s agencies to undertake multihazard risk assessments and
geotechnical surveys, and to monitor and mitigate the risks through appropriate engineering
design and disaster warning systems needs to be strengthened. More resources will have to be
devoted to build resilient infrastructure in the underserved areas of Bhutan to ensure that Bhutan’s
future growth is inclusive and sustainable.
26. Demographic challenges and labor demand and supply mismatch. Bhutan has a
fertility rate of about 2, and about 40% of the population is less than 24 years old. Bhutan also
faces challenges associated with aging, even before it has been able to tap its demographic
dividend and increase its income level. The share of population above 65 years is projected to
increase from 6% in 2022 to 17% by 2050, while the share of working-age population fell from
73% in 2000 to 40% in 2022. The growing emigration of youth and working-age people will further
worsen Bhutan’s dependency ratio. While the pandemic was the immediate cause of the increase
in unemployment (which fell disproportionately on service sector workers), youth unemployment
was a problem prior to the pandemic, and the jobless recovery is a symptom of deeper labor
market issues. There is a mismatch between the jobs that are available domestically and those
to which youth aspire. The government is seeking to modernize and reform its TVET system by
emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. Through the Digital
Drukyul program, the government plans to scale up digitalization to improve the design and
delivery of public services and raise labor productivity. While all these are necessary initiatives,
much more needs to be done to lower the cost of doing business, enable the growth of the private
sector (especially in labor-intensive industries), and reduce the dominance of SOEs so that more
job opportunities can be created.
37 Connectivity has continued to improve, with the total length of blacktopped roads increasing from 4,475 kilometers
in 2018 to 4,863 kilometers in 2022. However, there is high demand for road construction and improvement,
especially in rural areas, where 28% of respondents to the Bhutan Living Standards Survey (footnote 26) said that
building new or improving existing roads should be one of the government’s top priorities.

C. Implications for ADB Country Engagement
27. The 13th 5-year plan (for 2024–2029) (footnote 1) will be critical for Bhutan to diversify its
economy, promote private sector development, build resilience, address inequalities, and promote
broad-based economic growth. As noted (para. 20), the plan is ambitious and aims to lay down
the foundation to transform Bhutan into a $10 billion economy by 2034. Other major objectives of
the plan include achieving full employment with quality jobs, realizing energy self-reliance,
preserving Bhutanese culture, providing affordable housing, raising the total fertility rate to 2.1,
increasing access to essential food and medical items, and pursuing digital transformation.
28. Considering Bhutan’s growth performance and the main impediments to inclusive and
sustainable growth, ADB will consider the following strategic priorities under the CPS, 2024–2028.
29. Strengthen public sector management and enable private sector development. The
13th 5-year plan emphasizes the need to strengthen public sector management, reduce the fiscal
deficit, and mobilize more tax and nontax revenue. Technical support will be provided in
coordination with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to guide the rollout of the
goods and services tax, build capacity, and digitize tax administration so that domestic revenue
mobilization is increased. ADB will help the government in implementing the medium-term public
financial management strategy, including an integrated financial management information
system. It will continue to build the government’s analytical capacity, including of the Ministry of
Finance, National Statistics Bureau, and Royal Monetary Authority. ADB’s sovereign and
nonsovereign operations teams will work together to undertake sector feasibility studies and
provide transaction advisory services to promote public–private partnerships in health
diagnostics, solar power, and urban waste management, as requested by the government. This
will help catalyze private sector investment from within and outside Bhutan, improve design and
delivery of key public services, and reduce the burden on the government’s limited budget and
institutional capacity. ADB will assist in drafting a competition bill to ensure equal opportunities for
all businesses and in reforming Bhutan’s Bankruptcy Law to align insolvency procedures with the
needs of cottage and small-scale industries. ADB is working with the government to review the
FDI policy and improve the investment climate.39 Support will be given for reforming selected
SOEs to reduce crowding out of the private sector and the burden these SOEs place on the
budget. Bhutan’s banks will be assisted in transitioning to noncollateral-based lending and
increasing credit flows to businesses. For a landlocked country such as Bhutan, regional
cooperation and integration are critical for generating business and jobs. ADB will support reforms
to strengthen policies, institutions, and infrastructure for open trade, including simplification and
harmonization of cross-border protocols. It will target improvement in Bhutan’s trade digitalization,
competitiveness, and governance so that the full benefits from improved road and digital
connectivity along Bhutan’s southern border with India can be tapped to boost trade, business,
and employment opportunities. Strategic priority 1 will be supported through a mix of policy-based
loans, technical assistance (TA) for institutional strengthening, and knowledge work to support
reforms in public sector management, economic policies, and financial markets to remove
systemic obstacles and enable private sector development. The reforms and institutional
strengthening will reinforce the support under strategic priorities 2 and 3 to address infrastructure
bottlenecks and promote human capital development.
30. Build climate-adaptive and resilient infrastructure and systems. Given Bhutan’s
infrastructure gaps and the threat of climate change and disasters, ADB will strengthen support

different sectors and on all relevant rules and regulations related to private sector development.

for sustainable infrastructure investments. ADB will (i) help Bhutan (a) to expand its solar power
capacity so as to reduce its winter power deficit, and (b) scale up its hydropower capacity; (ii)
build a 92-kilometer highway connecting Lhamoizingkha to Sarpang along Bhutan’s southern
border with India to reduce travel time by nearly 2 hours and promote cross-border trade; and (iii)
support sustainable river basin management and resilient urban development. Under the new
CPS, ADB’s support will go beyond project-by-project mainstreaming of climate adaptation and
instead take an approach more focused at the catchment basin level by analyzing multi-hazard
risks and making the design and implementation of ADB and government projects more disaster-
resilient. The Building Adaptation and Resilience in the Hindu Kush Himalayas (Bhutan and
Nepal) TA project will build the capacity of relevant government agencies to undertake
geotechnical studies and design multi-hazard early warning systems.40 International best
practices for slope stabilization and management of landslide and flooding risks will be tailored to
Bhutan’s needs. ADB will use the project readiness financing facility to help Bhutan develop a
pipeline of well-designed infrastructure projects. Project teams will draw on multisector expertise
and explore private sector solutions where feasible, to ensure that integrated and long-term
solutions are being offered to Bhutan.
31. Support human capital development and enhance the employability of youth.
Human capital development is a priority of the 13th 5-year plan. ADB will continue to help Bhutan
in maintaining progress on the SDGs pertaining to education, health quality and access, and
gender and social inclusion. It will strengthen health systems, including primary, secondary, and
tertiary-level infrastructure and human resources for health; support digitalization of health
services; upgrade TVET facilities; and update course curriculum to align with emerging market
needs. ADB will provide advisory support for private sector engagement in evaluating possible
approaches to bring in requisite technical expertise and financing to create a network of
sustainable diagnostic facilities. In addition, policy and regulatory reforms will be supported to
establish a conducive environment for private sector engagement for both health and education.
To continue to improve TVET demand and quality provision, ADB will provide guidance to
strengthen vertical skills pathways through dedicated TVET vocational secondary schools and
market-driven, mid- to advanced-level skill programs to progressively acquire skills and green
competencies, improve employability and employment outcomes, and prepare the correct skill
sets for Bhutan’s priority and emerging sectors. ADB will continue supporting TVET and life skills
for youth with disabilities.
32. The country knowledge plan explains how strategic knowledge products and services will
be offered to the government to strengthen the analytical foundation for loans and TA projects
under the new CPS. For example, under strategic priority 1, ADB will help the government to
prepare feasibility studies for at least two PPP projects, support reforms of selected SOEs, update
the Insolvency Law, and draft Bhutan’s first national competition bill to enable more private sector
participation and attract FDI. ADB will support the Department of Revenue and Customs in
preparing a digitalization road map to modernize tax administration, design legislation for the
proposed goods and services tax, build capacity and raise awareness, and help in its rollout. ADB
will work with the Ministry of Finance, National Statistics Bureau, and Royal Monetary Authority
to strengthen their statistics and analytical capacity to enable policy formulation and
implementation to become more data and evidence driven.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO THE RNR CENSUS
About 62% of the total population in Bhutan constitute of the rural households depending on
RNR activities. The first RNR Census was conducted in year 2000 followed by the 2nd in 2009.
World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020 recommends the conduct of agricultural
census every 10 years. This is the 3rd RNR Census being conducted. The RNR Census 2019
aims to provide the Royal Government of Bhutan with an updated benchmark of RNR data at
the lowest administrative level, which will be useful for the formulation of agricultural and
rural development policies and improvement of food security of the population.
The RNR Census 2019 is in conformity with World Programme for the Census of Agriculture
(WCA), and covers all aspects specific to the farm holdings and holders, who are actually
engaged in agriculture, forestry and livestock including aquaculture. In addition, follow up
of uniform concepts would make results comparable at regional and international level. With
reduction in sampling and non-sampling errors.
Objectives and Outcome of RNR Census 2019
Objective
To collect a reliable database of its farmers / farm holdings, the role of the RNR Census is of
utmost importance, as it prepares list of households and holdings engaged in agriculture as the
first step. The objectives of RNR Census 2019 are;
• To establish a statistically sound system of data collection for the RNR sector in the country
with an integrated approach of follow up surveys, in conformity with WCA of the FAO of
United Nations.
• To meet data requirements of RNR Sector in the country, leading to a farm register &
covering structural characteristics of operational holdings in the country.
• To provide baseline data on RNR Sector with timeliness and also to strengthen the statistical
system of the country by way of efficient use of the existing facilities, capacity building on
human resources, infrastructure, technological innovations etc.
Outcome
The RNR Census will provide a wealth of new and reliable information, with open access of
the users to non-confidential data, disseminated via through the MoAF web-site and printed
publications and will include:
• structural data on RNR Sector available at spatial and temporal scale for national and
international comparisons;
• data on land tenure, land use;
• data on livestock:
• data on characteristics of agricultural holdings;
• data on agricultural employment and farm economy;
1
• data on agricultural machinery and equipment;
• information on agricultural production methods;
• farm labour and gender statistics on the contribution of women and men to agricultural
production and their access to agricultural resources;
• information on rural infrastructure at community level;
• benchmark data for current statistics and baseline data for evaluation of impacts of
agriculture and rural development programmes, etc.
Census coverage
The RNR Census will cover all the holdings in the rural and semi-urban area that depend their
livelihood from engaging in RNR activities i.e. agriculture, livestock and forestry activities.
The enumerators will enumerate every households/holdings as per the frame list.
Enumeration Area
The enumeration area for the RNR census shall be the area covered by the enumerators in a
day, in most cases this is a village of their respective Gewog.
Statistical unit of enumeration
The statistical unit is the individual holdings e.g. households, institutions, corporative entities,
etc.
Frame list
The WCA 2020 recommends the conduct of RNR census right after the Population and housing
census, which took place in Bhutan in 2017. The RNR frame updated the PHCB frame by the
RNR extension agents with support from Gewog administrative records.

CHAPTER 2: INSTRUCTION TO THE ENUMERATORS
Enumeration procedure
• Make contact with the Gewog head before approaching the interviewee. The Gewog head
will be informed about the RNR census and dates for the data collection.
• The RNR officials from each Gewog in the Dzongkhags will be enumerators and will
conduct the questionnaire assigned by their respective Dzongkhag Census Coordinator.
• Enumerators will be provided with a list of holders to cover.
• The enumeration will be done CAPI based, where enumerators will be using the Tablet
that they have been provided with to collect the data. Paper questionnaire for backup will
be provided.
• The enumerators will revisit those households 3 times that were not available on the day of
enumeration or previously for enumeration or the entire data collection period to minimize
non-response bias.
• Avoid interviewing in presence of other holders in order to avoid being influenced.
• Try to interview the household head as far as possible, if the household head is unavailable,
you may interview another responsible adult member of the household if that person is
fully familiar with the agricultural operations.
• Refrain from collecting data from children, neighbours or other persons who are not
members of the household. However, you may seek information from such people to help
set up an interview with the household.
The community based information will be collected from key respondents such as Gewog
officials of the respective Gewog.
General Instruction:
• Always begin the interview by introducing himself/ herself in the best possible manner,
always be polite and friendly.
• Explain the purpose and objectives of the census.
• State the confidentiality of their identity provided by the household.
• Ask the questions as stated in the questionnaire and record the answers accurately.
• Avoid paraphrasing questions: if the questionnaire ask, “What is your age?” do not rephrase
as “Your age must be 35 years, isn’t it?”
• Refrain from discussing any government and local issues besides your assigned
responsibilities (questionnaire).
• Respect the privacy of people.
• Always be in formal dress.
• Thank the respondent/local officials for their co-operation at the end of interview.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Rationale
1. Urban infrastructure facilities and basic services in Bhutan required improvement,
upgrading, and expansion at the time of project appraisal in 2006. The demand for urban services
and strengthened urban management in Thimphu and Phuentsholing as a result of high levels of
2
rural to urban migration and the resulting urban sprawl, required intervention.1 The Government
of Bhutan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide financial and technical
assistance2 to improve urban infrastructure and services in Bhutan’s two largest cities, Thimphu
and Phuentsholing, particularly in the cities’ newly expanded areas. The government also asked
for support in developing Dagana, one of the regional centers not previously assisted under aid
programs. It should be noted that Dagana has a limited tax revenue base due to its classification
in the non-urban category, and its administration’s operational expenses depend entirely on
central government subsidy e.g., for developing, maintaining, and operating public infrastructure
and services in its jurisdiction.
2. The coverage of the Bhutan Urban Infrastructure Development Project involved the
improvement, upgrading, and extension of urban infrastructure and services in Thimphu and
Phuentsholing, and one regional center, Dagana.3 The project had five components:
(i) improvements in Thimphu’s water supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste management,
and local area infrastructure development; (ii) enhancement of roads and footpaths, and social
infrastructure in Phuentsholing; (iii) improvements in water supply, roads, and drainage and
sanitation in Dagana; (iv) technical support through capacity building and training; and (v) project
implementation support. There were two special features: (i) public awareness support and
(ii) land pooling.4
B. Expected Impacts, Outcomes, and Outputs
3. The project’s impact was improved standard of living and sustained economic growth in
Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana. The outcomes were (i) improved urban infrastructure
planning and management; (ii) improved road access and drainage in South Thimphu,
Phuentsholing, and Dagana; (iii) increased quantity and improved quality of water supplied in
project areas; (iv) broadened sanitation coverage in project areas; (v) improved solid waste
management in Thimphu; (vi) improved community awareness on solid waste disposal, hygiene,
and sanitation; and (vii) increased capacity of the Thimphu City Corporation (TCC), Phuentsholing
City Corporation (PCC), and Dagana Dzongkhag (district or province) to undertake operational
and management activities and reduce unaccounted for water.
4. The project’s outputs were:
(i) Component A: Thimphu urban improvement. These were city-level
improvements in urban water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management; and
urban development in four local areas in South Thimphu comprising of new urban
road networks, utility conduits, and drainage connection in project areas in South
1 The 2005 national population and housing census confirmed that Thimphu’s urban population had increased at an
annual average rate of 12.6% from 2000 to 2005. The total migration to Thimphu from other districts was estimated
to be 34,378 people. National Statistics Bureau. 2008. Socio-Economic and Demographic Indicators.
2 ADB provided five technical assistance (TA) projects in the urban sector since 2000. These included two project
preparatory TAs to conduct detailed feasibility studies for two loans to the urban sector. ADB’s support in the sector
increased substantially through the Urban Infrastructure Improvement Project, completed in June 2005. This was
followed by the current project, and both loans focused on urban areas in Thimphu and Phuentsholing municipalities
and in Dagana.

Assistance Grant. Kingdom of Bhutan: Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila.
4 Land pooling is a technique used to redefine ownership of land in a way that creates a new configuration of plots that
is more appropriate for urban structures and uses. Urban land development is realized through the contribution of a
certain portion of land from each owner proportionate to the holdings, which produces sufficient land for the provision
of public roads, infrastructure, social facilities, and open space.

Thimphu, and water supply and sewerage networks in project areas in South
Thimphu.
(ii) Component B: Phuentsholing urban improvement. These consisted of
improvements in road network, junctions, footpaths, and parking lots; and
establishment of social infrastructure including an archery ground, a pedestrian
bridge, footpaths, and street lights.
(iii) Component C: Dagana urban improvement. These comprised construction of
water supply and sanitation facilities in Dagana as well as new urban roads and
drainage in central areas of Dagana.
(iv) Component D: technical support. This included providing support on raising
public awareness support and improving operational efficiency.
(v) Component E: project management support. This involved delivering
assistance to the project management unit (PMU) to support project
implementation unit (PIU) design, monitoring, and supervision.
C. Provision of Inputs
5. An ADB loan from its ordinary capital resources was approved on 27 September 2006 and
became effective on 31 January 2007. The loan closed on 31 August 2016, some 3 years and
8 months after the original approved closing date of 31 December 2012. The delay in completion
was due to (i) the underestimation at appraisal of the time needed to obtain the landowners’
agreements for land pooling, as based on the project completion report (PCR),5 a total of
99 hectares (composed of fragmented and at times untitled land parcels) was needed to establish
the urban infrastructure facilities of the project; (ii) the underestimation of the difficult terrain and
climatic working conditions,6 including delays in the slope stability study for Dagana; (iii) time
setbacks in the procurement of civil works because bidders were unable to fulfill tender
requirements necessitating re-tendering; and (iv) land acquisition problems i.e., delay in obtaining
100% agreement, which hindered the timely commencement of some of the civil works contracts.
6. The total project cost was estimated to be $30.8 million equivalent at appraisal. ADB would
provide a loan of $24.6 million, 80% of the total cost, while the government was to finance
$6.2 million. At completion, the project cost was $30.3 million—$23.6 million or 78% from the ADB
loan and $6.7 million or 22% from the government. Loan reallocation in April 2015 increased the
civil works proportion with reductions in the amount allocated to equipment and unallocated
funds.7
7. International consulting firms were engaged as (i) project management consultants
(51 person-months, international and 179 person-months, national) to assist the PMU and
(ii) design, monitoring, and supervision consultants (49 person-months, international and
68 person-months, national) to assist the PIUs. Consulting services were allocated
SDR1.76 million, with a total utilization of SDR1.18 million at project completion. An attached
5 ADB. 2017. Completion Report: Urban Infrastructure Development Project in Bhutan. Manila.
6 For example, there was a delay in the package Construction of Intake, Water Supply Main Chamgang, and Water
Supply Lines for Thimphu attributed to the long time required to haul heavy ductile iron pipes due to the steep
topography, which was compounded by the cold weather, resulting in harsh working conditions.
7 Civil works utilization increased, including water supply for all four project areas under land pooling. At completion,
civil works comprised 88% of the total loan amount compared to 55% at appraisal. The largest difference was for
equipment, amounting to a 10% reduction of the original allocation of $3.1 million. The government’s decision not to
install mechanical aerators at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), but instead upgrade it to a sequencing batch
reactor under a different ADB loan, reduced disbursements for equipment. Expenditures for training, surveys, project
management, vehicle rental, and office equipment were also lower. The largest component of this was training, which
was originally allocated $819,697, but only 9% of this was spent.
4
technical assistance (TA) project in the amount of $250,000 was approved in September 2006.
The TA project was effective December 2006 and was completed in December 2009, after a
1-year extension from the original approved closing of December 2008, to enable the completion
of surveys and databases on unaccounted-for-water (UFW) by the implementing agency.8
The attached TA project was implemented by ADB and the Ministry of Works and Human
Settlement (MOWHS) acted as the executing agency. The TA project supported the Department
of Urban Development and Engineering (DUDES) in developing a solid waste management
strategy and action plan for Thimphu, a geotechnical and slope stability study in Dagana, UFW
reduction and water calibration, and land pooling and urban facility management. The TA project
was rated successful in the PCR.
8. The project was category B for environmental safeguards and A for involuntary
resettlement. All landowners, although project beneficiaries, were considered affected persons.
The project was category C for Indigenous Peoples. These ratings on safeguards can be
considered as appropriate, based on prevailing conditions stated at project appraisal and
appropriate actions by relevant agencies during project implementation.
D. Implementation Arrangements
9. DUDES was the executing agency of the project and the implementing agencies were the
TCC for component A, PCC for component B, and Dagana Dzongkhag for component C, and
DUDES for components D and E. This was in line with the arrangements proposed at appraisal.
A PMU was established at DUDES, which was headed by a project manager. A central Project
Steering Committee (PSC) chaired by the secretary of the MOWHS facilitated coordination among
ministries, the executing and implementing agencies, and relevant stakeholders. The PSC
provided overall guidance and oversight to the PMU and PIUs.9 Three local PSCs were also
established in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana, which were chaired by the TCC thrompon
(mayor), the PCC thrompon, and the Dagana dzongda (district or province) to coordinate and
provide guidance to the PIUs for local implementation.
10. There were 55 loan covenants, of which 54 were fully complied with according to the PCR
(footnote 5). The project partly complied with the covenant on water and wastewater tariff
increases of 6% per annum until 2012. Only three increases took place during project
implementation, instead of the proposed annual increases, which were at 7% instead of 6% per
annum. However, there were delays in complying with the covenants related to securing a 100%
agreement from landowners for land pooling—this was resolved by introducing a pilot area, which
was a contiguous portion of the local area plans where 100% agreement with landowners had
already been reached.
II. EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS
A. Relevance of Design and Formulation
11. The PCR rated the project highly relevant. At the time of project preparation, urban
infrastructure facilities and basic services in Bhutan needed improvements to better absorb
8 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Capacity Building in Urban Infrastructure Planning and
Management in Bhutan. Manila (TA 4844-BHU).
9 The PSC was tasked to: (i) meet at least quarterly or more frequently if required; (ii) provide guidance for, and ensure
the implementation of policies for the project; (iii) assist in resolving interagency implementation problems; (iv) review
relevant reports and audit statements from the PMU and PIUs; and (v) ensure that conditions of the project
agreements with ADB were met.
5
migration to the major cities. Problems with existing infrastructure were evident—there was
inadequate water supply for the increasing population, wastewater and solid waste systems had
either been reached or were close to capacity, and inadequacies in other urban infrastructure and
services were present. The project design was responsive to the government’s development plan
set out in 2008, the Bhutan 2020 vision,10 its National Poverty Reduction Strategy,11 and the five-
year plans. The Eighth Five-Year Plan, 1998–2003 stressed the need to provide basic urban
services.12 The Ninth Five-Year Plan, 2003–2008 focused on poverty reduction and devolution to
local governments.13 The project design was aligned with the draft Bhutan Urban Development
Act, which included provisions for planned development and management of urban land and land
pooling.
12. The project outcomes were aligned with ADB’s Country Strategy and Program in Bhutan,14
supporting the overarching goal of poverty reduction through economic diversification.
Development strategies for achieving this included infrastructure improvements and basic skills
development. To avoid duplication of interventions by other development partners, and based on
an agreement with government, ADB continued to assist the towns of Thimphu and Phuentsholing
and also took up one of the remaining dzongkhag towns, Dagana. Since there was a need for
infrastructure development in the newly extended areas of Thimphu, the government, ADB, and
the World Bank agreed to split assistance in local area development geographically. ADB
financed development in South Thimphu, and the World Bank did the same in the northern areas.
13. The time needed to obtain landowner agreements for land pooling was underestimated
largely, and the project design should have considered the potential implementation difficulties
more thoroughly. The difficult terrain and climate issues should have been anticipated and re-
tendering delays foreseen.15 The design for the upgrading of the wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP) in Babesa was inadequate16 and the subproject was cancelled from the project but
eventually incorporated into a subsequent loan.17 The project design manifested these
weaknesses, and these would have inhibited the achievement of the outcome had measures not
been introduced to improve the design during implementation, e.g., land pooling (para.10). Land
pooling was a useful innovation, and this validation considers the project relevant based on
government needs and ADB’s country strategy, despite a few deficiencies in project design.

15 The most recent ADB assistance to the urban sector was through the Urban Infrastructure Improvement Project,
completed in June 2005. ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors:
Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Urban Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila. Lessons learned
from this and other urban projects funded by the World Bank and the Danish International Development Agency
indicated that resettlement issues should be negotiated and finalized early in the project cycle and sufficient funds
budgeted in advance, so that resettlement agreements would be completed on time.
16 The project design included upgrading the existing WWTP in Babesa. By installing mechanical aerators in the existing
facultative ponds, it had been expected that the capacity would increase to 5,250 m3/day. A study by the design,
monitoring, and supervision consultants in 2009 showed that with the installation of the aerators, the quality of treated
effluent under overloaded conditions would not meet standards and incur substantial capital and operational costs.
The PSC decided that no new connections would be accommodated to avoid overloading the WWTP. As an interim
measure, all new construction would require septic tanks for treating wastewater. Desludging equipment was
procured and sludge taken to the WWTP. A sequencing batch reactor is being designed through the ongoing project,
at an estimated cost of $11.1 million.

B. Effectiveness in Achieving Project Outcomes and Outputs
14. The PCR rated the project effective. These are the outcome achievement performance:
(i) Improved urban infrastructure planning and management (not achieved).
A total of 74 individuals participated in various training activities, although the
target was over 280 government staff from DUDES, TCC, PCC, and Dagana
dzongkhag trained on various aspects of project implementation and municipal and
infrastructure management. The PCR noted that the target was underachieved
because of the government’s decision to use its own financing for training and
capacity building rather than loan funds.
(ii) Improved road access and drainage in South Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and
Dagana (achieved). New networks of 37.2 kilometers (km), from a target of
28.5 km, to benefit over 63,360 people (target 70,000 people).
(iii) Increased quantity and improved quality of water supplied in project areas
(achieved). New water treatment plants (WTPs) with a capacity 6,500 cubic
meters per day (m3/day) from a target of 6,000 m3/day in Thimphu, 300 m3/day
from a target of 300 m3/day in Dagana, and 27 km from a target of 27 km of supply
main and associated infrastructure installed, to provide access to safe water to an
additional 63,360 people from the target of 55,000 people in Thimphu and
1,282 people from the target of 1,200 people in Dagana.
(iv) Broadened sanitation coverage in project areas (partly achieved). Sewerage
coverage in Thimphu was increased from 12% to around 20% through an
expansion by 28.5 km from a target of 16.5 km of the wastewater collection
network. The collection network will be connected when the WWTP is upgraded in
the next project. The target was to upgrade the WWTP from 1,750 m3/day to
5,250 m3/day. Wastewater in Dagana is treated through septic tanks that are
desludged and treated in sludge drying beds constructed under the project (against
a target of over 50% of residents of Dagana served by a newly constructed sewage
treatment plant and collection system).
(v) Improved solid waste management in Thimphu (achieved). The project
improved solid waste collection and management capacity by constructing a new
road to the unloading bay access road and procuring desludging equipment,
dumper placers, and containers. At project completion, the collection had reached
50 metric tons per day (MT/day), against a target of TCC’s solid waste collection
and management capacity improved to potentially cover 10 years of waste
generation and satisfactory disposal of 85 MT/day of solid waste by 2018.
(vi) Improved community awareness on solid waste disposal, hygiene, and
sanitation (partly achieved). The public awareness component and wash
program were implemented in Thimphu (against a target of conducting the
program in both Thimphu and Dagana).
(vii) Increased capacity of TCC, PCC, and Dagana dzongkhag to undertake
operational and management activities and reduce UFW (achieved).
Improved operational efficiencies included the TCC’s UFW reduction to 25%
against a target of significantly improved operational efficiencies of TCC, PCC, and
Dagana dzongkhag with UFW reduced from 34%–50% to 15%–20%.18 The PCR

an uninterrupted basis. Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services, Country
Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014─2018.

noted that efforts are being made to reduce UFW further with the replacement of
old pipe networks with new ones in the core city area.
15. At the output level, there were four categories of targets to be achieved in Component A,
Thimphu Urban Development.
(i) City-level improvements in urban water supply, sanitation, and solid waste
management.
(a) Water supply (achieved). At project completion, 63,360 people against a
target of 55,000 people had access to safe water through the constructed
WTP with a capacity of 6,500 m3/day (from a target of 6,000 m3/day) and
its reinforced cement concrete intake, 26.9 km water mains and associated
infrastructure.
(b) Sanitation (not achieved). Wastewater collection networks 28.5 km long
were constructed in Thimphu, but will only be connected when the WWTP
is upgraded under the next project. The target was over 19,000 people with
access to safe sanitation through an expansion of more than 16.5 km of
the sewerage network and upgraded WWTP from 1,750 m3/day to
5,250 m3/day.19
(c) Solid waste (achieved). At project completion, the collection reached the
50 MT/day target of satisfactory disposal with 85 MT/day of solid waste
collected by 2018 through the rehabilitated landfill and composting plant,
and new waste collection and landfill facilities.
(ii) Urban development in four local areas in South Thimphu (achieved).
The project constructed houses that can accommodate more than 25,000 (target
of 11,000 people).
(iii) New urban road networks, utility conduits, and drainage connection
constructed in project areas in South Thimphu (achieved). The project built
33.7 km of secondary and tertiary roads with drainage, approximately 25.7 km of
ducting for power and telecommunication and 265 access shafts for cables and
associated structures against a target of 19.4 km of secondary and tertiary roads
with drainage constructed, as well as approximately 14.6 km of ducting for power
and telecommunications, 650 m of service pits, and associated structures.
(iv) Water supply and sewerage networks completed in project areas in South
Thimphu (achieved). Secondary and tertiary water distribution network 31.6 km
long was constructed against the targeted 30 km and a sewerage collection
network of about 28.5 km, (from the target of 16.5 km) with 819 sewer manholes
(against a target of 300), 1,411 water and sewer inspection chambers, and
associated structures.
16. Achievement of output targets in Component B, Phuentsholing Urban Improvement were
as follows.
(i) Improvements in road network, junctions, footpaths, and parking lots for the
city (achieved). The project constructed 2.7 km of road network, 1.2 km of
retaining walls, two culverts, two roundabouts, three road dividers, 2.9 km of
drainage, 3.0 km of footpaths, and six parking lots (against the target of 2.4 km of
road network and road junctions improved; four parking lots, and 1.2 km of
footpaths.
19 The PCR noted that the PSC decided that new connections in the four areas under land pooling would not be
connected until the WWTP is upgraded under the next project
8
(ii) Social infrastructure (archery ground, pedestrian bridge, footpaths, and
street lights) in the city (achieved). Against a target of constructing facilities
including a pedestrian bridge, approximately 100 street lights, five fire hydrants, an
archery ground, and a mini-stadium, the following facilities were built by the
project—613 street light poles, 32 fire hydrants, two pedestrian bridges, 534 m
realignment of water supply pipeline, and miscellaneous structures.20
17. There were two categories of output targets in Component C, Dagana Urban
Improvement.
(i) Water supply and sanitation facilities in Dagana (partly achieved).
Approximately 1,282 people (target 1,200) were provided with access to safer
water with the construction of the WTP that has a capacity of 300 m3/day (against
the target capacity of 300 m3/day) and the 7 km (against the 8 km target)
transmission main and associated infrastructure. Four random rubble masonry pits
(sludge drying bed) and a 225.0 m access road were constructed instead of a new
sewerage network because of financial viability issues. The target was that
approximately 790 people would have access to safer sanitation through
connection to the new sewerage network and a sewage treatment plant with
capacity of 300 m3/day.
(ii) New urban roads and drainage in central areas of Dagana (partly achieved).
The project addressed drainage mainly through slope stabilization works. The road
sub-base was built but final surfacing will be undertaken using government
financing.21 The target had been that approximately 1,000 people provided would
have access to 1.1 km of newly constructed roads with drains.
18. For Component D Technical Support, the output targets had two categories.
(i) Public awareness support. The consultant recruitment was completed by late
2007 and the public awareness component and wash program was implemented
by SNV Bhutan, including the public hygiene workshop and metering workshop in
Dagana.
(ii) Operational efficiency. A total of 74 individuals participated in various trainings,
below the target of 280 persons.
19. Component E Project Management Support output target achievements included:
(i) Project management unit support. A fully functional PMU was established by
the fourth quarter of 2007 although consultants were shortlisted in Q1 2007.
(ii) Design, monitoring, and supervision support for project implementation
units. All the bid documents for works, goods, and services were prepared in line
with the provisions of the loan agreement, project administration manual, ADB’s
Procurement Guidelines, Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian
Development Bank and Its Borrowers, and standard bidding documents.
The necessary staff were in place in the respective PIUs to implement the project
components as per the planned schedule.
20 Including one water pond, eight gazebos, one basketball court, an archery ground, one canteen with toilet facilities,
and three planter boxes.
21 The government decided not to build blacktopped roads immediately and only provided a sub-base. This took
account of experience in the areas under land pooling in Thimphu. Roads constructed prior to the erection of buildings
were damaged because of their use by heavy vehicles.
9
20. The safeguards performance assessment confirmed that the project was category B for
environment, category A for involuntary resettlement, and category C for Indigenous Peoples.22
The initial environmental examination was thorough and included adequate environmental
impacts and mitigation matrix, as well as environmental management plans. The negative
environmental impacts associated with construction during implementation were temporary and
localized and were addressed appropriately. For example, at Thimphu, the impact of the
encroachment on precious ecological areas was planned to be mitigated by reinstating vegetation
on slopes and any other bare earth surfaces. Consultations with affected persons were
undertaken throughout the project, following the Environmental Assessment Guidelines. There
were no complaints over environment safeguards, although there was observed weakness in the
environmental management plans. They contained insufficient information due to insufficient
monitoring to assess compliance with appraisal requirements.
21. After extensive consultations with the local population, land pooling was the selected
option for the project’s resettlement and compensation framework, guided by relevant government
and ADB policies. While social impact assessments and resettlement planning materially met
ADB’s requirements, the safeguards assessment noted that the only resettlement monitoring
report dated 2011 was silent on the number of displaced persons requiring compensation and
assistance, actual compensation and socioeconomic status before and after land pooling
(footnote 9). Nevertheless, the PCR reported that resettlement impacts were appropriately
identified during the design stage and that asset losses and temporary disruptions were minor.
The PCR also stated that complaints received through the grievance redress mechanism were
resolved at field level, although details of these were not contained in the resettlement monitoring
report.
22. The project had no negative gender impacts. The social analysis conducted during project
preparation showed that there was already gender equality, with women accorded equal or higher
status, particularly regarding property inheritance, managing domestic finances, business, and
household decisions—with women often heading households and businesses. The significant
environmental and public health benefits from the project accrued to the general population
(women and men). The project’s water supply component specifically benefited women because
women had a higher involvement than men in household and agricultural activities. This validation
rates the project effective despite the observed shortfalls in achieving output targets, as resulting
project outcomes were not negatively affected.
C. Efficiency of Resource Use
23. The PCR rated the project efficient. The reevaluation of the project’s economic internal
rate of return (EIRR) confirmed its achievement in providing incremental improvement in urban
services, which would subsequently lead to improved environmental quality in Thimphu,
Phuentsholing, and Dagana.
24. The EIRRs were recomputed for the project and its individual subcomponents.
The recalculated EIRR for Thimphu components ranged from 14.1%–22.9%, compared with
estimates of 17.2%–24.0% at appraisal. The recalculated EIRRs for the Phuentsholing
component was 23.8%, compared with the 29.0% at appraisal. The recalculated EIRR for the
Dagana component was 12.3%, compared with 11.9% at appraisal—exceeding the benchmark
22 ADB (IED). 2018. Project Safeguard Assessment: Urban Infrastructure Development Project. 16 May (internal).
10
rate of 12.0%. The EIRR for the whole project was 15.5% compared with 21.0% at appraisal.23
The lower EIRR at completion was partially attributed to the reduced sewerage component in
Thimphu; although the project remained economically viable through various scenarios in the
sensitivity analysis: (i) base case, (ii) 10% increase in operation and maintenance (O&M), (iii) 10%
increase in capital costs, and (iv) 10% decline in beneficiaries scenarios. Increased land values
were used as measures of economic benefits from land pooling (as the intention of the scheme
was the use of the land value increase to compensate for the asset losses of individuals) and
slope stabilization, although ADB guidelines advise against using such data.24
25. The requirement to obtain 100% landowner agreements for land pooling, while ensuring
ownership by beneficiaries and significantly reducing grievances, contributed to the 2-year
start-up delay. The project succeeded in advancing part of the infrastructure construction in May
2009 by dividing one local area plan (LAP) into a pilot area and a non-pilot area. The pilot area
selected was a contiguous portion of the LAP where 100% agreement had already been reached.
This enabled construction in the pilot area and the demonstration effect was crucial in securing
agreement from the remaining landowners because it built trust in land pooling, which was being
implemented for the first time. There were also delays because of the difficult terrain and climate
(footnote 4),25 including that of the slope stability study for Dagana. Procurement of civil works
was also delayed because of the need to re-tender contracts when bidders were not able to fulfill
all requirements, while there were also delays in land acquisition necessary for some of the civil
works contracts. These problems contributed to the 3.8-year delay in project completion.
The recomputed project EIRR at completion confirmed an overall return equal to or greater than
the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital. Process efficiency was not rated highly since the
project suffered various delays. The implementing agencies acted efficiently to minimize the
impact of delays, and 93% of the total loan proceeds were disbursed. This validation rates the
project efficient, in view of continuing project viability indicated by EIRRs and achieving most
targets.
D. Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability
26. The project was rated likely sustainable in the PCR. The method used to reevaluate the
financial internal rate of return (FIRR) followed the method adopted at appraisal.26 The FIRR for
the water supply subprojects was recalculated at 1.9% upon project completion, higher than the
appraisal estimate of -4.0%. The higher return was attributed to changes in the technology of the
water supply subprojects in Thimphu, and higher tariff increases during implementation than
anticipated.27 The FIRR for the solid waste management subproject was recalculated at -6.8%
against -10.7% at appraisal. The recalculated FIRR for the project was 2.2%, higher than the
23 The results of the sensitivity test show that even under unfavorable scenarios—a 10% increase in capital costs, O&M
costs, a 10% decline in revenue, and 1-year delay in project completion, the EIRRs remain higher than the economic
opportunity cost of capital of 12%.
24 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. Many factors affect land prices and there is
often a strong speculative element in price increases. The advice provided in the ADB guidelines is that as much as
possible, efforts should be made to identify and value individual benefits other than land prices.
25 For example, there was a delay in the package Construction of Intake, Water Supply Main at Chamgang and Water
Supply Lines for Thimphu attributed to the long time required to haul heavy ductile iron pipes because of the steep
topography, compounded by cold working conditions.
26 The FIRR for the sewerage subcomponent was not recalculated: major investments were deferred to the subsequent
Urban Infrastructure Project of ADB.
27 The increase is at least partially attributed to government’s expansion of district municipal boundaries to include
agricultural areas in 2011. This took place in Thimphu and has contributed to the increase in revenues.
11
-7.5% at appraisal. The estimated weighted average cost of capital was 1.4%28 compared to
1.0%–1.2% at appraisal. This indicates the financial viability of the investments when taken as a
whole, although the solid waste management component was not financially viable.
27. Based on the PCR, the TCC is expected to have current account surpluses from fiscal
year (FY) 2018 to FY2024 and the PCC from FY2015 to FY2024. For the TCC, the project
incremental O&M costs are not a financial burden, since incremental revenues fully cover the
incremental costs from 2016 onward for water and sewerage components. The urban
infrastructure improvement in the project LAPs has enabled the TCC to acquire significant
revenues from the land and urban house tax. The TCC increased its joint water supply and
wastewater tariff three times during implementation, while periodic tariff increases are part of its
plans for improved sustainability. Likewise, for the PCC, incremental revenues from the parking
investments are projected to exceed incremental O&M costs from 2016. Government support
exceeds the value of the surplus up to FY2016 in the PCC and up to FY2021 for the TCC.
The implication is that project outcomes and outputs are financially sustainable, even without
government support after FY2016 in Phuentsholing and after FY2021 in Thimphu.
28. The application of the resettlement framework was institutionalized in the government’s
land pooling practices with some modifications. Environmental management was given high
priority; the Eleventh Five-Year Plan emphasizes sustaining a balance between development and
the natural environment to improve disaster resilience.29 On the other hand, although the physical
network for water supply covers 100% of Thimphu, only 30% of the service area gets
uninterrupted water supply.30 On a positive note, government has prioritized provision of 24-hour
water supply for all towns in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.
29. The financial viability of the project investments was confirmed by the PCR, although
sustainability is unlikely in Dagana.31 However, this validation views the assessment of
environmental sustainability as limited due to the lack of information i.e., project environmental
monitoring reports did not contain sufficient information and monitoring data to assess compliance
with project-specific requirements, based on the project safeguard assessment (footnote 22).
The ability of local governments to plan and prepare budgets, manage O&M, and deal with private
sector service providers requires strengthening.32 Nevertheless, since the FIRR exceeds the
weighted average cost of capital, and given the relative effectiveness of the TCC and the PCC in
project implementation, this validation assesses the project likely sustainable. It should be noted,
however, that action should be taken to bring the solid waste management component to financial
viability, e.g., through the application of tariffs that enable cost recovery.
28 Sensitivity analysis was undertaken: under varying scenarios, the FIRRs ranged from 1.49% to 2.22%. The results
indicated that the project would remain financially viable under sensitivity assumptions with a 10% increase of O&M
cost, 10% increase in capital costs, and a 10% decline in beneficiaries.

31 Insufficient O&M arrangements were identified for Dagana’s water supply since the dzhongkhag was unfamiliar with
the requirements for the proper maintenance of the system.

house capacity.

III. OTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS
A. Preliminary Assessment of Development Impact
30. The PCR rated the impact of the project—improved standard of living and sustained
economic growth in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana—satisfactory. The impact was planned
to be monitored 3 years after the end of the project to assess the improvement in well-being
measured by the United Nations Development Programme national human development
indicators and vulnerability index in urban areas, and the improvement in the indicators measuring
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
31. A 2016 report by the MOWHS confirmed that Thimphu had the highest average number
of healthy days in a month, which was attributed to health facilities and improved sanitation
facilities. Health and hygiene were promoted through the behavior change communication
strategy prepared under the project. The improvements in managing solid waste in Thimphu has
led to more investments in the landfill site. Operationalizing a compost plant led to reductions in
the amount of waste dumped in the landfill and produced saleable compost. Citywide
improvements in urban infrastructure and the transformational impacts of land pooling were
significant for Thimphu.
32. Infrastructure from the project transformed South Thimphu and provide directions for
Bhutan’s further urban development, particularly the project-supported land pooling scheme.
Land pooling is now considered as a model for urban development in Bhutan. Households in
areas under land pooling are served by piped water connections and all buildings use septic
tanks. Once rehabilitated, all plots are envisioned to be connected to the WWTP through the
sewage network installed under the project. Investments in Phuentsholing included urban
infrastructure, which reduced traffic congestion and improved access and drainage, provided self-
financing parking spaces and civic amenities for communities, and increased safety through street
lighting that covered 70% of the town. This validation considers the project impact satisfactory,
since it is likely to have positive development impacts that outweigh the negative, based on
reported project results.
B. Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency
33. The PCR rated the performance of the borrower and the executing agency satisfactory.
The project design reflected the government’s national and local urban development policies and
plans, ensured ownership and additional counterpart financing of $0.6 million. There were
effective implementation capabilities at the PMU and PIUs at the TCC and the PCC, with
leadership and key staff members engaged and retained throughout project implementation; this
was less so for the Dagana PIU, which led to implementation delays. The project design
recognized the requirements for capacity development for the borrower, the executing agency,
and government staff from the DUDES, TCC, PCC, and the Dagana dzongkhag. Nevertheless,
the budget of $900,000, which was allocated for training was underutilized because of
government policy decisions (para. 14).33 This validation rates the performance of the borrower
and executing agency satisfactory because of the effectiveness of the PSC, PMU, and PSCs and
PIUs within the TCC and PCC in project implementation.
33 This is apparent in the Dagana dzongkhag whose existing staff neither benefited from training under the loan nor
from external sources. The distant location of Dagana dzongkhag, and the relatively small works therein led to
infrequent trips by the PMU, PMC, and the design and supervision consultants.
13
C. Performance of the Asian Development Bank and Cofinanciers
34. The PCR rated ADB’s performance satisfactory. During the 8-year implementation period,
ADB fielded 10 project administration missions totaling 261 staff person-days. This PCR deemed
this sufficient for satisfactory supervision. ADB’s safeguards work quality at appraisal was
satisfactory, but there was a shortfall in monitoring the implementation of the environmental
management and resettlement plans per the project safeguard assessment (footnote 22).
The quality of environmental and resettlement monitoring reports of 2011 and 2012 were
assessed as less than satisfactory, since they neither contained sufficient information nor
monitoring data to assess compliance with project requirements. ADB promptly responded to
requests for the approval of contracts and ensured timely fund disbursements. This validation
rates ADB performance satisfactory.
D. Others
35. Land pooling process. The results of the land pooling exercise were transformational
and the 2008 Bhutan’s National Urban Strategy cites ADB’s land pooling as an appropriate
approach for urban development, which is equitable, participatory, does not disturb existing
developed properties, and automatically resolves legal and social disputes. The Bhutan’s National
Urban Strategy further cites the TCC’s experience in land pooling as a pioneering attempt that
has been taken as the basis of indigenous adaptation of the method in other towns.
IV. OVERALL ASSESSMENT, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Overall Assessment and Ratings
36. The PCR rated the project successful based on ratings of highly relevant, effective, efficient,
and likely sustainable. The project was relevant to the government’s urban development efforts.
Land pooling was a pioneering initiative, which was unprecedented in scale, and it transformed
southern Thimphu into a well-planned urban area. The government adopted this pilot as a model
for urban development nationwide. This validation rates this project effective since it substantially
achieved its intended outcomes, and in some cases, exceeded its targets. The PCR rated the
project efficient and economically viable as well as likely sustainable based on projected financial
revenues. This validation also rates the project successful, although unlike the PCR, it was only
rated relevant due to deficiencies in project design, and less than effective because of the shortfall
in achieving its outcomes and outputs. The efficient, and likely sustainable ratings of the PCR are
supported. The table summarizes these ratings.

B. Lessons
37. Project-level lesson. The DUDES, TCC, and PCC, need to provide additional support for
investments in the urban sector to ensure adequate funding to maintain, build capacity and public
awareness, and improve access to urban services. The government’s policy calls for Thimphu
and Phuentsholing city governments to outsource maintenance rather than to develop in-house
capacity.34 This requires the DUDES, TCC, and PCC to enhance skills in project and program
management and outsourcing.
38. Results framework and methodology-level lessons. When doing the design and
monitoring framework (DMF) exercise, outcomes should describe the immediate and direct
benefits of the project. Outcome statements articulate the change the project is expected to
achieve—in this case, the management of in-migration. No separate outcome statement or
concept was included in the DMF. Monitoring the project impact was expected to be the
improvement in well-being, measured by the United Nations Development Programme’s national
human development indicators and vulnerability index in urban areas, and an improvement in the
achievement of the indicators of the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, it is doubtful
if these indicators and indices would provide adequate impact indicators and targets since it is
difficult to assess the project’s contribution to their achievement. Hence, a more realistic approach
when setting performance indicators should have been endeavored, and ensuring chosen
indicators are monitorable and measurable is a lesson inferred from the project.
C. Recommendations for Follow-Up
39. There are two recommendations for the project. The PCR stated that the land pooling
supported under the project is now considered a model for urban development in Bhutan. ADB
could disseminate the lessons learned from this successful pilot. This validation opines that an
impact analysis could be considered for 2019 or later, with special emphasis on land pooling and
its effects to urban development.
34 ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014─2018. Manila.
15
V. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP
A. Monitoring and Reporting
40. A project performance management system was designed in compliance with the
covenant set out in the loan agreement. However, it is possible that the project performance
management system was not comprehensive since there appears to be limited environmental
information available. A major weakness of the DMF was that there was no outcome statement,
suggesting a lack of a problem analysis during preparation.
B. Comments on Project Completion Report Quality
41. The PCR followed the prescribed guidelines and is coherent. However, this validation
notes that there was no mention of the project’s gender dimension, and although the report and
recommendation of the President asserted that no special measures were necessary, the PCR
would have added value if it included a discussion on the project vis-à-vis gender at completion,
e.g., how the project benefitted women and the vulnerable. The assessment of relevance omitted
a discussion on consistency with ADB country and sector strategies, and project design
deficiencies were evident, e.g., there were many components implemented simultaneously and
sequencing of works became a challenge. The EIRR and FIRR analyses were adequate, although
the use of land price increases as a benefit can be further debated on land pooling cases.
Otherwise, insights that could be used for the design and implementation of future projects were
present, with the recommendation to take the land pooling experience forward. The PCR is rated
satisfactory, although this validation notes that project changes and/or updates were not reflected
in the project DMF.
C. Data Sources for Validation
42. This validation was based on reviews of the report and recommendation of the President,
PCR, loan review mission reports, and the project safeguard assessment.
D. Recommendation for Independent Evaluation Department Follow-Up
43. Further outcome or impact assessment can follow-up on project achievements brought
about by the upgrading of the wastewater facility in Thimphu and the bridge to be constructed in
Phuentsholing, Urban Infrastructure Project,35 as both are envisaged to bring further development
impacts to the two project cities. ADB’s Independent Evaluation Department could consider
preparing a project performance evaluation report upon completion of the second project, and
assess the combined impact of the two projects, with a parallel focus on the innovative strategy
of land pooling in urban development.

Foreword
The Kingdom of Bhutan is endowed with abundant renewable
hydropower potential. Over the last four decades, hydropower
has assumed national strategic importance and is the main driver
and backbone of the nation's economy. The phased development
of hydropower with the present installed capacity of 2,335 MW
over a span of four decades with commensurate grid expansion
and promotion of small, medium and large industries has brought
tremendous socio-economic benefits to the people of Bhutan.
Even the remotest parts of the country today have access to clean,
reliable and affordable electricity.
The Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy (SHDP 2008)
was adopted in 2008 with the objective to accelerate hydropower
development and to diversify investments in the sector. However,
the acceleration with the projected generation capacity additions
and the expected economic growth and the enhancement in the
wellbeing of the Bhutanese people did not take place. .I nstead, it
generated a lot more controversy undermining the confidence of
the Bhutanese people in the hydropower sector. The priorities of
the Government and aspirations of the people have since evolved.
There is now this immense desire emerging to diversify the end
use of the electricity generated, especially through establishment
of clean and energy intensive industries, to generate employment

and provide income at the grass roots level. As a key strategic
national resource, there is a growing sentiment that the benefits
from hydropower should accrue to all the people of Bhutan and
not fall into the hands of a few. These evolving priorities and
aspirations have created a compelling environment for a review of
the SHDP 2008.
The domestic demand for electricity is continuing to grow and
is projected to soon exceed firm generation capacity. While
development of hydropower should keep pace with the increase
in domestic demand, a key challenge facing the sector is the low
proportion of firm power vis-a-vis the installed capacity as every
hydropower project developed so far is a run-of-the river scheme.
Strategic interventions are now a necessity to enhance energy
security through reservoir/pump storage schemes and integration
of hydropower with other renewables. There are opportunities to
pursue innovative energy storage by-products such as hydrogen
fuel, green ammonia and other emerging technologies to add value
to the clean energy, besides providing reliable and affordable
electricity to domestic consumers while ensuring competitively
priced electricity for export. The revised policy addresses these
prerogatives to enhance energy security and develop value chains
in the domestic market, and generate export revenues.

Preface
Bhutan is endowed with an abundance of renewable hydropower
potential. It has an estimated hydropower potential of 36,900
MW with annual production capability of 154,000 gigawatt hours
(GWh). Over the last four decades, hydropower has assumed a
stature of national strategic importance and is today the backbone
and driver of the nation's economy. Hydropower has spurred
Bhutan's high economic growth rates over the last couple ofd ecades
and its export revenues are helping the country to meet much of its
recurrent and capital expenditures. The Bhutanese people are also
deriving tremendous direct social and economic benefits with even
the remotest regions of the country now having access to clean,
reliable and affordable electricity. This success with hydropower
therefore created a heightened sense of urgency to accelerate the
development of its hydropower potential as Bhutan strives to
gradually wean away from its huge dependence on external aid to
implement its developmental plans.
In early 1980s and 1990s, hydropower development was
more measured with a staggered implementation, primarily in
collaboration with the Government of India. However, in the last
decade, there has been a huge thrust on accelerating hydropower
development, especially encouraged by the win-win benefits of the
Bhutan-India bilateral projects. The two governments ~ntered into
an overarching umbrella agreement in 2006 to develop 5,000 MW
of additional hydropower generation capacity by 2020. To facilitate
the accelerated mode of implementation, Bhutan introduced its
Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy in 2008 that enabled
public and private investments in the sector to complement the

already very successful bilateral co-operation with the Government
of India.
However, the 5,000 MW target was enhanced to 10,000 MW in
2008 and this was formalized-through a Protocol entered into
between the two governments in 2009. The new understanding
through the Protocol was that India would help Bhutan develop the
10,000 MW generation capacity by 2020 through the time-tested
bilateral modality and Joint Venture modality between the public
sector undertakings of the two countries. Therefore, private sector
investment was kept in abeyance, as it no longer figured in the
2009 Protocol.
Meanwhile both private sector investment and joint venture
modalities have come under a lot of scrutiny and criticism with
the public perception that such arrangements tend to benefit a few,
which is contrary to the constitutional provisions that the resource
belongs to the State and therefore that the benefits should accrue to
all the people of Bhutan.
While there is a consensus that hydropower is the backbone on
which the future of Bhutan's economy will have to continue to ride
on, there is a growing desire and aspiration that the hydropower
sector has to value add and create many more opportunities for
gainful employment and productive engagement of in
B~utanese
providing goods and services commensurate with the investment
size and the debt burdens as the people ofB hutan have to ultimately
bear the responsibility for servicing these debts. There is also a
felt need to diversify activities within the hydropower sector
such as venturing into hydropower research and development,

manufacturing, and construction to help further build Bhutanese
capacity.
There are also growing concerns regarding the competitiveness of
Bhutan's hydropower in the Indian power market, especially with
a situation emerging in India where supply is surpassing demand,
at least under the present scenario. It will be critical for Bhutan to
maintain its comparative advantage in costs and flexibility of supply
to participate in the evolving energy markets in the sub-region/
region and maximize benefits through trading of surplus electricity.
To make electricity pricing competitive, there is as always, the
need to continue to ensure that hydropower is developed in a
most efficient and cost-effective manner. Domestic industries and
other economic ventures need to be also encouraged to continue
to add value to electricity, so that their products are competitive
in the market and a multiplier effect is generated in the Bhutanese
economy. However, keeping electricity pricing competitive will
be difficult with the ever-increasing cost of construction and the
likelihood of new policies being introduced such as environmental
flow requirements amongst others.
The domestic demand for electricity is likely to continue to grow
at a rate that may soon exceed firm generation capacity. While
development of hydropower should keep pace with the increase
in domestic demand, a key challenge facing the sector. is the low
proportion of firm power capacity vis-a-vis the installed capacity
due to the highly varying seasonality-based river discharges.
Innovative mechanisms such as integrating solar and wind energy
with hydropower need to be explored to enhance energy security to
meet the base load in the future. Economic stimulus will also need
..
to be provided for energy storage by-products such as hydrogen

fuel, green ammonia and other such technologies that could
consume some of the otherwise huge summer surplus in efforts to
flatten out Bhutan's highly seasonal energy generation regime.
While committed· and extensive efforts are being made for the
preservation of its pristine ecology and environment, Bhutan has
not been spared from the impacts of global warming and climate
change. The impact is already visible by way of its receding
snowlines and fast melting glaciers, which are the major "storage
facilities" of Bhutan's water resources. There is a need to step up
collective efforts for integrated management of the watersheds and
catchment areas. With water becoming a scarce resource across the
world, there is a heightened need and urgency to actively pursue
the smart management of our water resources through cascades of
check dams and reservoirs. Through such proactive and proven
measures, Bhutan can expect to remain resilient and adapt to the
severe impacts of global warming and climate change for achieving
both water and energy security.
With the changing times, emerging issues, and evolving market
conditions, the Government constituted a Committee to review
the complete hydropower sector and prepare a strategy report with
recommendations on how best this strategic resource could be
developed to ensure maximum benefit to the people of Bhutan.
The Hydropower Development Strategy Report 20 7 was an
~
outcome of extensive consultations amongst all the stakeholders
and a thorough review that was undertaken. It was approved as the
strategic roadmap for Bhutan's hydropower development in 2019.
The Strategic Report recommends a clear way forward including the
pacing and timelines for hydropower development in consideration
of the changing· economic, market, social and environmental

scenarios in addition to the country's evolving plans and policies.
One of the key recommendations of the Strategic Report is also for
a review of the Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy 2008
together with the Electricity Act 2001.
A thorough review of the SHDP 2008 has since been undertaken.
In taking forward the hydropower sector in a holistic manner, the
Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy 2021 is expected to
guide the overall development of Bhutan's abundant hydropower
resources in consonance with the national economic development
goals, other relevant policies and laws, and more importantly to
benefit the nation and achieve the larger aspirations of its people
for peace, prosperity and happiness.

Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy, 2021
1. Introduction
Hydropower is a strategic renewable energy resource for the
Kingdom of Bhutan. It has enabled economic growth and
industrialization and has been fundamental in enhancing the living
standards of the people, and is the backbone of Bhutan's economy.
The strategic importance of hydropower is enshrined in the
Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan. During the National
Day address on 17th·December 2013, His Majesty commanded
that "Hydropower is considered as our nation's most precious
resource that belongs to all the people of Bhutan." This was further
reinforced during the 14th Convocation of Royal University of
Bhutan on 24th May 2019, where His Majesty commanded that" ...
enlightened economic policies ensured that benefits from valuable
national resources such as hydropower was neither captured by
narrow economic elite nor influential foreign investors. Instead, it
was judiciously developed by the State to strengthen our economy
and benefit the nation and the people at large."
Inspired by the His Majesty's farsighted vision, the hydropower
resource is sustainably harnessed by the State to provide reliable,
adequate, secure and affordable energy for all Bhutanese, while
exploring export opportunities to enhance revenues. As such, the
hydropower resource is the raison d'etre for fulfilling the country's
aspirations of social wellbeing and economic prosperity. The
policy aligns the mode of hydropower development such that it not
only maximizes benefits to the nation but also ensures that these
benefits accrue equitably to the people of Bhutan.
Further, with ever increasing domestic demand, a major shift in
focus is required from the development of Run-of-River (ROR)
