Chapter 1
I
NTRODUCTION
Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been passing through a
period of power transition. The center of gravity of international
politics has shifted to Asia because of the economic and military rise
of two aspiring powers—India and China. Most importantly, the rise
of China as a revisionist power, which has been attempting to set up a
new world order by challenging the US-led western dominated world
order,1 and growing strategic partnership between the US and India to
maintain a balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region, has larger geo-
political ramifications. In this regard, three regions (Indo-Pacific West,
the Himalayas, and the Indian Ocean region), three countries (the US,
China, and India), and three issues (climate change, controlling of the
global supply chain, and humanitarian intervention) will dominate
international politics in the future. These three regions have already
witnessed intense competition between these three powers in the post-
globalisation period. While the US has been trying to maintain the power
balance in the Indo-Pacific region ever since it adopted the policy of
Asia pivot, it has perhaps felt the imperative to diverse its engagement
in the Himalayan and the Indian Ocean Regions (IOR) with increasing
focus on power balance due to Chinese expansionist designs and
aggression in these areas against India since May 2020.
In this context, the geo-physical location of the Himalayas makes it
important not only in the Asian politics but also the entire world. The

in the post-Cold War period when China directly and indirectly attempted to
set up a new world order by challenging the existing US-dominated world
order. The debate gained momentum during the period of Obama
Administration. For further reading see, Bennett Collins, “USA: Status Quo

Himalayas works as an axis of Asia by connecting South Asia, Central-
Northern Asia, and the South East Asia. Its varied topography and
climatic conditions has worked both as a facilitating and disjointing
system between major civilisations of Asia. Therefore, since time
immemorial, “stability” in the Himalayan region has remained the central
issue to all the countries that are part of the region. Historically, many
military expeditions, conflicts, treaties, and agreements have been
undertaken to keep the region stable, both in terms of bilateral relations
and domestic politics. However, the concept of stability is not limited
to only strategic balance. The region has to maintain ecological, cultural,
and domestic power politics balance to make it safe and conflict-free.
In the contemporary world, the stability factor in the Himalayan region
has reached its zenith as the two Asian giants—India and China—
attempt to dominate global politics. Given their structural differences
and internal fault lines, their mutual suspicion increases as they grow
and try to set up a new world order. In that context, both countries
interpret peripheral (immediate neighbourhood in case of India) stability2
as the first line of defence to secure the core. While stability is a common
issue for both countries, differences in their approach and understanding
to maintain stability in the common neighbours have resulted in instability
in those countries. This has baffled smaller countries in South Asia in
general and the Himalayan countries—Nepal and Bhutan—in particular.
For instance, while China interpreted monarchy as the stable institution
in Nepal, India felt that constitutional monarchy with multi-party system
2 Commenting on the dissolution of the House of Representatives in Nepal
in December 2020, former Foreign Secretary of India and Ex-Ambassador
to Nepal, Shyam Saran, observed that “India’s long term interest in [Nepal]
is best served by a stable multiparty democracy and economic prosperity for
which India remains an irreplaceable partner” (“Unfolding Crisis in Nepal”,
The Tribune, 30 December 2020, available at https://www.tribuneindia.com/
news/comment/unfolding-crisis-in-nepal-191159). Earlier, commenting on
the same situation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian,
said “…relevant parties in Nepal can take into account the national
interests…commit themselves to political stability and national
development” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PRC, 28 December 2020, available
at https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/
t1843027.shtml).

would ensure better stability. In the post-monarchy period, while China
has been trying to establish a single party communist government by
unifying major Marxist–Leninist–Maoist parties of Nepal, India, on
the contrary, has been trying to consolidate multi-party democracy under
an inclusive new constitution. In this race for stability, Nepal has witnessed
series of political transitions since its emergence as a buffer between
India and China in 1950.
Given the growing interests of the major powers in the Himalayan
region and its intrinsic linkages with the Indian Ocean, both in terms
of conventional and non-conventional aspects, it is pertinent to
understand the responses and approach of Nepal and Bhutan to achieve
their economic, security and foreign policy objectives, which are
mentioned in their newly adopted constitutions, in the context of
changing geo-political scenario.
Unlike other countries (emphasis here is on sea-opening countries),
given the geo-political factors, these Himalayan countries’ foreign policy
is mostly determined by peripheral developments and less by internal
issues. While analysing the foreign policy behaviour of Nepal, Prof.
Lok Raj Baral has observed that “it is more so for a small and landlocked
country like Nepal whose maneuverability is low because of the
geography which continues as a determining factor in foreign policy.”3
However, there are instances of small countries having taken advantage
of big power rivalry. For instance, despite their geographical proximity
to two emerging powers in Asia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have
shown better maneuverability capacity. Both are strategically important
to India and China, given their strategic location and access to sea lanes.
From India’s point of view, both Nepal and Bhutan are special
neighbours that share open border with deepening civilisational linkages.
The open border arrangement facilitates people-to-people contact,
tourism, bilateral, and transit trade. Most importantly, it also reflects

Post, 6 September 2020, available at https://kathmandupost.com/columns/

mutual trust, friendship, and respect for each other’s sovereignty and
independence. The open border makes livelihood easier and
comfortable for millions of unskilled citizens of these three countries.
Other than that, India has been suspicious about Chinese expansionist
programme, which has been guided by Mao Tse Tung’s policy of
“Tibet as palm and five Himalayan kingdoms as the fingers.”4 Chinese
occupation of Tibet is deeply ingrained in Indian psyche that China
might attempt to integrate other countries in the Himalayan region.
Keeping that in mind, in the post-independence period, India continued
the British India frontier policy with Himalayas as the formidable defence
barrier (FDB). India integrated its frontier policy with the security of
Nepal and Bhutan. The 1949 and 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship
with Bhutan and Nepal respectively were used as deterrent against
Chinese aggression towards south of Himalayas. Not only Nepal, but
also other immediate countries find special place in India’s
neighbourhood policy given their deepening cultural linkages and
geographical proximity. Therefore, India expects its immediate
neighbours to take note of its sensitivity while engaging with extra-
regional powers.
STRATEGIC HIMALAYAS
The strategic importance of the Himalayas (broadly known as Hindu
Kush Himalayas, which connects eight countries) underscores both in
terms of conventional and non-conventional aspects. Both aspects are
equally important to human security of Asian region. From the non-
conventional security point of view, the Himalayas have been the major
source of ten Asian rivers with largest deposit of snow after the
Antarctic and the Arctic. Therefore, it is called the Third Pole because
it holds the largest reserve of fresh water outside the Polar regions.
These rivers have been contributing towards growth and prosperity

of Asian civilisations since time immemorial because of their perennial
flow due to snow and monsoonal rains. That provides irrigation, power,
and drinking water to over 250 million people who live in the Himalayan
region and another 1.65 billion living downstream of these rivers.5
There is also an intrinsic linkage between the Indian Ocean and the
Himalayas. The Himalayas regulates the South Asian monsoon, which
supports livelihood of millions of people in South Asia. The Himalayas
also prevents cold waves from the Central and Northern Asia towards
the South Asian sub-continent.
The Himalayas has been a major source of economic life for eight
Hindu Kush Himalayan countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan—as an attractive tourist
destination, deposits of precious minerals, and herbs for medicinal
purposes.
From the conventional security point of view, since time immemorial,
the Himalayas has been protecting Indian sub-continent against military
expeditions from Central and North Asian rulers due to high elevations,
rough terrain and hostile climatic conditions. The significance and vitality
of the Himalayas to the Indian sub-continent is also mentioned in
various ancient Indian religious texts, including the Vedas and the Puranas.
The Himalayas was one of the geo-cultural identifications of India in
the ancient history.
The Vishnu-Purana makes it clear that the Himalayas formed the frontier
of India. It states that the country south of the Himalayas and north of
[Indian] Ocean is called Bharat, and all born in it are called Bharatiyas or
Indians.6
In fact, various ancient and modern historical evidences suggest that
Himalayas was considered a “formidable defence barrier” to protect

large empires like Maurya and Gupta from the challenges across the
Himalayas. These empires had used the Himalayas as the northern
frontiers and adopted special security, neighbourhood, and trade policies
with the neighbouring countries.7 For example, ancient Indian political
thinker, Chanakya, mentioned about Raja-mandala in the Arthasastra to
deal with immediate neighbours and frontiers.
Similar policy was adopted during the British rule in India. The British
policy of recruiting Gurkhas in the Indian security forces was an attempt
to send clear message to the smaller countries of the sub-continent to
feel ownership of the region and lend their support to protect both
cultural and territorial unity of the region. Since India inherited the
British India territory, independent India continued with the same policy.
The Himalayas figured strongly in India’s northern defence and foreign
policy. Describing the importance of the Himalayas to protect India’s
northern frontier, former Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru,
on 6 December 1950, said in the parliament: “From the time
immemorial the Himalayas have provided us with magnificent
frontier…we cannot allow that barrier to be penetrated because it is
also the principal barrier to India”.
Unfortunately, the relevance of the Himalayas as a formidable defence
barrier (FDB) reduced drastically after the Chinese occupation of Tibet.
It brought a landmark change in the balance of power in the Himalayan
region. The buffer between the two biggest civilisations of the world
shrank. As China’s border expanded up to the Indian border, India
landed into border disputes with China, which was not a signatory to
the McMahon Line as per the 1914 Shimla Convention between British
India and Tibet. While the Republic of India inherited the British India
land and accepted the McMahon Line as the legal border, China rejected
the same by stating that Tibet was never independent.
China established first direct road link between Kathmandu and Lhasa
by constructing Arniko Highway in 1963. The impregnable barrier has
been under challenge after Nepal joined the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) in May 2017. China has also declared setting up of China–Nepal

multimodal trans-Himalayan connectivity network. Under this project,
China has committed to set up railways, highways, transmission lines,
and integrated check posts at the China–Nepal borders. China’s
ambitious trans-Himalayan policy synchronises with Nepal’s aspirations
of reducing dependence on India and re-tuning India–Nepal bilateral
relations by bringing changes in the 1950 Treaty, other bilateral
agreements and the open border arrangement. The changing dynamics
in the Himalayan region and structural changes in India–Nepal relations
could weaken India’s guard in the northern frontiers.
Similarly, China has been using multiple pressure tactics with Bhutan to
have its presence in Thimphu. First, it claimed Bhutanese territory in
the northern and western borders and forced Bhutan to engage in
border dialogue since 1984.8 During the border dialogue, China offered
bigger territory (originally that was Bhutanese territory) in the northern
border in exchange for smaller territory in the western border, which
is closer to India’s chicken neck region. Surprisingly, China once again
claimed more territories of Bhutan in July 2020 when China objected
to Bhutan’s application for a grant from the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) Council to develop the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary located in
eastern Bhutan. One media report indicated that on 5 July 2020, the
Chinese foreign ministry officially reiterated its claim that the China–
Bhutan boundary has never been delimited and there “have been
disputes over the eastern, central, and western sections for a long time”,
cautioning “third party” to refrain from stepping into the breach.9
Second, China had unilaterally tried to change the border position in
the Doklam region, a disputed tri-junction between Bhutan–China–
India, on 16 June 2017. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Bhutan, it conveyed to the Chinese side, both on the ground and through

the diplomatic channel, that “the construction of the road inside
Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the agreements…”10 Third,
Bhutan still figures in the Chinese Himalayan occupation policy as stated
in Mao Tse Tung’s statement of Tibet as palm and five Himalayan
kingdoms as the fingers. China has not yet withdrawn this statement/
policy officially.
FOREIGN POLICY OF SMALL STATES11
There are many definitions of small states. While some have argued
that geography, population, and level of international influence constitute
the major objective criteria, others are of the view that many small
countries do not conform to that framework as they have played a
major role in international politics despite being small in size. Since the
material aspects were not sufficient to define the small states, two
scholars—Robert Rothstein and Robert Keohane—argued that the
psychological dimension must form part of any objective criterion to
define the small states; while some states believe that they are unable to
protect their territorial integrity in their own capacity.12 This definition
may not be sufficient to explain the behaviours of small states. In fact,
there are many big countries which have joined military alliances to
defend their territory. Therefore, a state’s capacity to defend itself or
secure itself should not be the only criterion for defining small states.
10 Press Release, 29 June 2017, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Royal Government
of Bhutan.
11 Scholars have defined small states in terms of geography, economy,
population, and military capability. For example, Miriam Fendius Elman
(1995) has projected the US as a small state prior to the mid-1800s. He uses
the word small in the context of economy and power. Geographically,
demographically and economically in comparison to India and China, Nepal
is a small country but not in comparison with the Maldives and Bhutan. In
terms of military capability and economics, it is a small state. Therefore,
Nepal is deemed as a small state in terms of geography, military, and economic
size, in this study.
12 Jeanne A.K. Hey (ed.), Small States in World Politics: Explaining Foreign Policy
Behavior, London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2003, pp. 2–3.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 15
For example, Nepal does not fall into the small state category in terms
of geography and size of population if one takes into consideration
the definition given by the United Nations (UN). Although the UN
does not differentiate between small and big states and treats them
equally, there is a Forum of Small States (FOSS), with population under
10 million, within it. The FOSS was formed at the initiative of Singapore
in 1992 in New York as an informal grouping of small states. The
Commonwealth and World Bank define a small state as sovereign
country with a population size of 1.5 million or less.13 Population-wise,
Nepal does not qualify as a small state, but its economy and military is
small compared to two previous material criteria. In fact, many scholars,
including those from Nepal, consider Nepal a small state compared to
its two neighbours. Therefore, this study analyses the foreign policy
behaviour of Nepal as a geographically small and landlocked country.
In the case of Bhutan, it falls in the small state category in all aspects.
However, some Bhutanese scholars often argue that Bhutan is a small
state only on the basis of geography and population, not on the basis
of sovereignty, national security, resources, and culture.14
Small States in Global Politics
In the present times, as in the past, studies on International Relations
have been driven by the politics of the big powers, or mainly the five
permanent members of the UN thereby reflecting the hegemony of
the P5 in the UN Security Council. They have the power to veto any
UN resolution that affects them or any of their allies. They often justify
interventions in the name of preservation and protection of human

rights, stability, global norms, and world peace, without taking into
account the interests or sentiments of other countries. No small country
has the luxury of ever acting in this way, because for them “diplomacy
[not demonstration of power] is the tool of statecraft.”15 Therefore,
when (offensive) Realists argue that states are seeking to maximise their
power, it is true only in a limited sense in case of small countries. In the
past, small countries like Cuba, Finland, and Taiwan, have taken
advantage of the competition between big powers, but very few small
countries have the ability to manoeuvre or influence world politics. In
the post-Cold War period, small states received more international
visibility and feel secure because of the presence of UN and other
multilateral organisations that play active international roles to defuse
crises. However, some small states, which played key roles during the
Cold War period, have lost their influence in the post-Cold War time.
Nepal is an example. Although it did not play any major role
internationally, it certainly played a major role at the Himalayan sub-
regional level. It managed to leverage its own interests by engaging
both India and China, sometimes playing one against the other. At the
same time, it also kept its option of engaging with western powers,
especially the US, open. The US has reciprocated the same with the
objective to monitor India–China relations from Nepal.16
There is a dominant view (Neo-Realism) in International Relations (IR)
that the foreign policies of small states are affected more by international
politics and less by domestic developments. M.L. Elman observes:
“The received wisdom in the field [International Relations theories] is
that domestic determinants will be less salient when studying small
state behaviour because external constraints are more severe and the
international situation is more compelling.”17 This premise may not,

however, apply to all small states. Some small states are more affected
by their immediate neighbours’ foreign policy. In the case of Nepal, its
foreign policy is determined more by regional political developments,
especially those relating to China and India, than its domestic
requirements. Their strategic rivalry has deep impact on Nepal much
more than the other states of the same size and capability.18 Therefore,
the small states find less importance in the Realist Schools’ analysis
since these states cannot create and influence any international system
established by the major powers.
A small country’s ability to pursue an independent foreign policy further
declines if it is landlocked and economically dependent on another
country. Even a third power is less effective in terms of becoming a
balancer or protector due to its physical remoteness.19 Although Nepal
tried to diversify its foreign policy during the 1960s by establishing
relationships with other countries, it did not yield the desired results.
Nepal established diplomatic relations with the US in 1947, before it
did with any of its neighbours. Interestingly, on several occasions, both
China and the US expressed their inability to offer any help to Nepal
when its relations with India were strained. Informally, both recognised
the southern Himalayas as India’s sphere of influence.
Since small countries’ foreign relations are more prone to external
developments, their foreign policy behaviour changes accordingly. S.D.
Muni has observed that both internal and external variables have
determined the foreign policy of Nepal. As far as external variables
are concerned, it has been observed that the small countries in South
Asia, including Nepal, took advantage of the big power politics in the
region during the Cold War and enhanced their bargaining power vis-
à-vis India. As far as internal variables are concerned, Nepal’s internal
politics has influenced the country’s India policy more than India’s policy
towards Nepal. This is because of the frequent conflict between the
18 M.G. Partem, “The Buffer System in International Relations”, Journal of
Conflict Resolution, Vol. 27, No. 1, March 1983, p. 5.

forces who wanted to retain status quo and those who wanted change
at internal political level since 1950s. The regimes in Nepal took
advantage of international developments rather than influencing them
in any manner.20 Its tactics have been mostly hedging in the post-Cold
War period. At the same time, its dependence on India forced Nepal
to take cognizance of India’s sensitivities about its relationship with
China. Thus, the foreign policy of Nepal has been operating at three
levels: domestic/regime interests, sub-regional power politics, and global
developments.
A small and landlocked country located between two big powers is
less affected directly by international developments because the big
powers surrounding it absorb the pressure. However, since small
countries are part of the international system and regional sub-system,
they are more influenced by their immediate neighbours rather than a
third power or any external powers. According to Barry Buzan and
Ole Waever: “Smaller states will usually find themselves locked into an
RSC [Regional Security Complex] with their neighbours, great powers
will typically penetrate several adjacent regions, and superpowers will
range over the whole planet.”21 There have been occasions, when small
states have invited third parties to counterbalance their neighbours. But
even if Nepal takes help of a third power, it may not be effective vis-
à-vis India, and, at the same time, its geo-strategic location would
demand that it maintain a non-antagonistic relationship with China.
For example, western countries have been trying to influence Nepal on
the Tibet issue for the last 50 years. But Nepal has ignored them and
adopted a policy that has largely suited Chinese interests. Similarly, despite
the pro-monarchy policy (especially against the Maoists) followed by
the US since 2001 and its opposition to the 12-point agreement, the
US felt compelled to support India’s 2005 peace initiative in Nepal
given its influence in this region. As one Nepali analyst observed: “On
20 S.D. Muni, India and Nepal: A Changing Relationship, Delhi: Konark Publishers,
1992.

Security, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 46.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 19
regional issues, with exception of those related to Pakistan, the US
administration was content to give India the lead,”22 for larger strategic
gains. Moreover, given the complexity of the regional power-play and
asymmetry of Nepal with its neighbours, it is perceived that Nepal is
well-placed to take advantage of the economic development of both
India and China without having to play them off against each other.
However, that may not be the case all the times. It would be worth
mentioning that except during India–China conflict in 1961, Nepal has
largely failed to reap benefits of India–China rivalry. It has been
observed that Nepal’s importance or ability to use India–China rivalry
in its favour diminishes during the period of friendly and cooperative
relationship between India and China. Post 1961, there have been many
phases of strained relationship between India and China. During those
periods, Nepal once again failed to take advantage because it chose to
remain neutral in face of tension between the two countries. For
example, during Doklam conflict, Nepal had declared to stay neutral.
Moreover, over a period of time, Nepal has failed to prove itself as a
credible regional power, one that can influence international system.
Other factors include its internal political instability, imbalanced
dependence on neighbours, and western donors’ influence in the society.
Survival Tactics of Small States
There could be a psychological reason behind diversifying of foreign
policy to make Nepal and Bhutan feel free of any territorial interest
from its two immediate neighbours. They also adopt tactics like balanced
relationship, non-alignment and promotion of multilateralism to
dissociate from their neighbours and send a message across the
international community that their foreign policy is independent. They
use these tactics as deterrent against any aggression towards their survival
and security. This has been an inherent syndrome of the small and
landlocked countries, especially those located between two major

powers. Therefore, they use different tactics in foreign policy like
“isolation, alliance, submergence to dominant power, policy of
equidistance, development of leadership, reliance on international
organisations and regional systems.”23 Some international scholars have
recently argued that small states use hedging tactics to seek economic
benefits from big powers.24 Among these, diversification of foreign
policy has been the most popular tactic because it gives the small state
political, economic, and security guarantee. Although these smaller
countries enter into alliances and treaties with major powers close to
their borders, they continue to suspect the neighbouring countries’
behaviour towards them and thus prefer multilateral arrangements.
Although, initially, survival and security were the major guiding principles
of formulating foreign policy of Nepal and Bhutan, they have been
adopting completely different tactics to preserve their independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity given their common geographical
location. Even when they went for diversification of foreign policy,
their approaches varied. In the post-democratic period, both the
Himalayan countries have laid emphasis on economic development
along with security concerns. While Nepal was already in dilemma to
reconcile between India’s neighbourhood policy and the BRI, the US
offer of $500 million grant under the MCC (Millennium Challenge
Corporation) complicated the matter further. Instead of taking
advantage of the triangular competition, Nepal is soaked into the big
powers’ rivalry. Likewise, Bhutan has been in dilemma to reconcile
between diversifying economy, India’s sensitivities, Chinese pressure
on opening mission in Thimphu, and American involvement in
rehabilitating Bhutanese refugees. As small states in comparison to these
three powers, both Nepal and Bhutan cannot influence, alter or impact
on their own or in a small group the unfolding situation in Asia in
general and the Himalayan region in particular at present.25

With this background, it is worth examining the responses of Nepal
and Bhutan to the emerging regional order unfolded due to
development and infrastructure packages offered by the major
powers—India, US, China—in the Himalayan region.
SIGNIFICANCE AND METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY
Most recent studies on Nepal and Bhutan have generally focused on
their relationship with India. In case of Nepal, recent studies are mostly
on its policy towards two neighbours in the pre-2015 Constitution
period. There has been no in-depth study conducted to analyse new
trends in foreign policy of Nepal and Bhutan in the post-monarchy
period and establishment of democratic rule. Although democracy in
Nepal was introduced formally in 1990, this study covers the foreign
policy behaviour of Nepal in the post-monarchy period, which also
coincided with introduction of democracy in neighbouring Bhutan.
The present study is based on information collected from both primary
and secondary sources. Government documents, foreign policy reports,
statements of senior leaders and interviews have been used as primary
sources. Secondary research inputs have involved constant monitoring
of day-to-day developments and events from open sources. Books,
research articles, commentaries, private research institutes’ reports and
relevant websites have also been used for the study.
Certain sections in this monograph are taken from my earlier
publications. Those sections are improved and updated as per the
contemporary geo-political developments in the Himalayan region.

Nepal occupies a unique position in South Asia. It is a small and
landlocked semi-buffer state,26 located between two Asian powers that
have fought a war with each other. It shares geographic, historical and
cultural linkages with both countries. There are several empirical studies
on the foreign policy of small and buffer states, but not many on a
country with the special characteristics of Nepal—landlocked and
located between two rival powers.
Nepal figured prominently in world politics during the Cold War. It
lost its importance, to some extent, with the China–US rapprochement
in 1972 and then again post 1991. However, it has always figured
prominently in the power politics of the Himalayan region. Since the
mid-1990s, Nepal gained importance because of the strategic
developments following the start of the Maoist movement in the
country (in 1996), the emergence of China and India as Asian economic
26 Many scholars do not consider Nepal as a buffer state because they believe
that Nepal is not a neutral country. John Chay and Thomas E. Ross (Buffer
States in World Politics, 1986, pp. 25–30) observed that a “country with buffer
state status is the result of two powerful states desiring a stable or neutral
zone located between them. The buffer serves to keep the peace by functioning
as physical barrier between the potential combatants.” Since its formation,
Nepal has behaved as a neutral country. It did not take sides during 1962
Sino-India conflict. It has been adhering to Panchsheel as part of its foreign
policy. It does not have any military alliance with its two neighbouring
countries. Nepal was also one of the founder members of the Non-Aligned
Movement. However, geographically, it has failed to form a physical barrier
given the large borders it shares with China and India on its northern and
southern flanks. Therefore, Nepal’s role as a buffer is limited to separating
the two rival powers and is mostly based on “the distribution of power
within the regional context, i.e., balance of power among the rival states.”

powers, and the global campaign by the US against terror beginning
2001. The presence of US since then has altered the geo-political
dynamics of the region. Traditionally, India, which considered South
Asia as its natural sphere of influence, has not been comfortable with
the idea of sharing its influence with extra-regional powers in the region.
Given the changing relationship between the US and India from 2000
onwards, the former has, to some extent, endorsed the latter’s policy
towards Nepal. However, the two countries differ significantly in their
perspectives towards Nepal. For example, the US was opposed to
India’s move to engage the Maoists in 2005. On the other hand, China
was suspicious of the US presence in Nepal, because the presence of
extra-regional powers in the country could instigate anti-China
movements spearheaded by Tibetan refugees there.
The US revisited its policy towards Himalayan region, including Tibet
and Nepal, by integrating that in its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter
the BRI, which Nepal joined in May 2017. The US passed several
legislations related to Tibet from 2018 onwards. Four months after the
BRI agreement, the US signed the $500 million MCC agreement with
Nepal. While Nepal was already in dilemma to reconcile between India’s
neighbourhood policy and the BRI, the offer from the US complicated
the matter further. Instead of taking advantage of the triangular
competition, Nepal is now soaked into the big powers’ rivalry.
EVOLUTION OF NEPAL’S FOREIGN POLICY
Being a small and landlocked country, the focus of Nepal’s foreign
policy was on survival and protecting its territorial integrity from its
neighbours.27 During the Panchayat regime, any threat to the monarchy
was considered a threat to the sovereignty of the country and vice
versa. Thus, the survival of the monarchy became synonymous with
state security. As a result, Nepal’s foreign policy was designed to protect
its territorial integrity by maintaining a balance between India and China;
adherence to UN principles and joining regional organisations;
27 S.D. Muni, Foreign Policy of Nepal, New Delhi: National Publishing House,
1973.
24 | NIHAR R. NAYAK
establishing relations with extra-regional powers to reduce dependence
on both countries; and international recognition.28 Articulating Nepal’s
foreign policy priorities in view of its geographic reality, King Prithvi
Narayan Shah opined that Nepal was like a yam between two boulders
and should maintain an equal relationship with China (then Tibet) and
India. S.D. Muni has observed that the foreign policy objectives of
small states like Nepal are motivated by security (territorial integrity
and military), stability (political and economic) and status, but these
motivations may not be enough to decipher Nepal’s foreign policy.
Therefore, some structural factors that influence it need to be examined.
The structural factors may be constant (for example, geography, history,
socio-cultural ties with its larger neighbour) or variable (for example,
nationalism and political system).29 To fulfil its foreign policy objectives,
Nepal adopted the strategy of:
(i) taking advantage of differences and clash of interests between
India and China;
(ii) reducing dependence on both neighbours by diversifying its
foreign relations; and
(iii) mobilisation of international contacts for building counter-
pressures.30
The Rana rulers established a good relationship with British India by
acknowledging the Empire as the pre-eminent power in the region.
This policy continued till the departure of the British from the sub-
continent. While India was passing through its post-independence
political transition, the Ranas established diplomatic relations with the
US and other countries to counterbalance India, which wanted the
Ranas to keep pace with political changes in the region (in other words,

Survey, Vol. XXVI, No. 11, November 1986.

bring about political reforms), and seek international recognition.
Meanwhile, the communist movement in China and its aggression in
Tibet in 1950 altered the security situation in the Himalayas. The Chinese
view of Tibet as the palm of a hand and adjacent territories like Nepal,
Bhutan and some parts of Indian territory, such as Sikkim and
Arunachal Pradesh, as the fingers increased Nepal’s vulnerability. Worried
over these developments, India and Nepal signed two treaties in July
1950: the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and the Treaty of Trade and
Commerce.
Given the growing dissatisfaction against the Rana autocracy and
demand for establishment of democracy, which was spearheaded by
the Nepali Congress (NC), India helped to establish constitutional
monarchy and multi-party democracy in the country. This was to ensure
a progressive, stable and strong Nepal that would be sensitive to India’s
security concerns. Some Nepalese believe that India exploited the anti-
Rana feelings of the democratic forces to compel the then rulers to
sign the 1950 Treaty. But the fact of the matter was that while both
Nepal and India were negotiating a standstill agreement, the Communist
victory in China in October 1949 and its claim on Tibet in January
1950 altered the geo-political dynamics in the Himalayan region. An
intelligence input over a possible Chinese military move into Tibet by
the mid-1950s heightened security concerns for both India and Nepal.
Furthermore, Nepal might have been interested in entering into a new
agreement with India after the British withdrawal from India and
objections of the Soviet Union and Ukraine to Nepal’s entry into the
UN on the issues of sovereignty and independence in May 1949.31
Since then, the Friendship Treaty has remained the guiding force in
India–Nepal relations. Moreover, India and Nepal shared a special
relationship given India’s role in the restoration of the monarchy. Till
1955, India largely influenced the foreign policy of Nepal.32 However,

after 1955, the monarchy became increasingly assertive and was reluctant
to allow the democratic forces to function independently. One of the
main reasons for India’s support for restoration of the monarchy was
to see a democratic regime which embodied people’s aspirations to
assume power. But the monarchy perceived India as being inimical to
its interests as democracy would lead to dilution of its power.
Nepal’s foreign policy took a new shape after King Mahendra assumed
power in 1955. He deviated from his father’s India-dependent foreign
policy and formulated an independent foreign policy by diversifying
Nepal’s relationship with other countries. The major driver for this
change was his desire to consolidate the monarchy, weaken the
democratic movement, and mobilise international support for the
monarchy. Since India was proposing a mixed (constitutional monarchy)
political system, he tried to neutralise India’s influence by signing a parallel
Treaty of Peace and Friendship with China in 1960. He also tried to
reduce Nepal’s dependence on India by seeking more development
aid from western countries. In doing so, Mahendra took advantage of
the differences between China and India, and also became a party to
the containment policy of the big powers. His policy was compatible
with the interests of external forces in the Himalayas.
China reciprocated Nepal’s efforts towards neutralising India’s influence
and offered “political support for the Nepal King’s domestic policies
together with generous economic assistance”.33 China, in fact, took
advantage of the rift between Mahendra and the Indian establishment.
It did not react immediately after King Mahendra’s dissolution of the
first democratically elected government and the royal coup. China’s
silence was a signal that the monarchy was a stable power centre. Its
support for the authoritarian regime was reflected in Chinese Vice
President Chen Yi’s praise for King Mahendra’s leadership while
welcoming the Nepali delegation to the Joint Committee on Nepal–
India Boundary Commission to Peking in February 1961. Subsequently,
China also assured King Mahendra of all kinds of economic and military
33 S.D. Muni, n. 20, p. 24.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 27
support.34 Moreover, being a small country under constant threat for
its survival, Nepal adopted the principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of others and articulated it at the UN and other
international summits.
Mahendra’s son Birendra, who assumed power in 1972, followed his
father’s domestic and international policies but went one step ahead by
declaring Nepal a Zone of Peace (ZoP) in 1975. Pakistan and China
endorsed this seven-clause declaration, which was immediately accepted
by more than 70 other countries which endorsed it on the condition
that it should be accepted by Nepal’s neighbours. India, however, did
not endorse it. A major objective of the ZoP was to neutralise India’s
influence in Nepal by undermining the 1950 Friendship Treaty. Despite
knowing that India would not endorse the proposal, the king went
ahead with the plan to consolidate his regime by neglecting India’s
security concerns. The ZoP remained a major objective of Nepal’s
foreign policy till the establishment of multi-party democracy in 1990,
but did not figure prominently in its foreign policy articulation because
India ignored it altogether. The proposal, it may be noted, was made
soon after the formation of Bangladesh. The US was among the
countries interested in restraining India in the aftermath of the emergence
of Bangladesh.35 The king may have been apprehensive that monarchy
might face a similar fate in the future. Birendra was also worried about
India’s support to the democratic forces in Sikkim. Last, but not the
least, the proposal came while the monarchy was facing stiff resistance
from the NC, which was using Indian territory for its campaigns. Under
Clause 5 of the ZoP proposal, India would have been forced to take
action against the NC and the monarchy would have maintained the
status quo forever.
Nepal’s foreign policy acquired a new shape with the promulgation of
the 1990 Constitution. With the introduction of democracy and multi-

party system, the role of monarchy in politics diminished to some
extent. The political parties were not interested in the ZoP proposal.
Nepal’s relationship with India also improved significantly. Thus, post
1990, the ZoP proposal evanesced. The democratically elected
governments focused more on maintaining a balanced relationship with
India and China.
A few years later, Nepal attracted international attention once again
with the onset of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. The complex
relationship that Nepal shared with India and the US underwent change
with the onset of the global war on terrorism and a consensus emerged
between the three countries. Nepal–US relations were strengthened
with the exchange of high-level visits. During this period, US aid to
Nepal, which had been reduced between 1970 and 2001, was doubled.
Review of the existing treaties between India and Nepal dominated
discussions during bilateral visits. However, during the royal takeover
in February 2005, King Gyanendra tilted towards China and Pakistan
to counterbalance the Indian and Western opposition to his action.
Though, at one point of time, the Chinese authorities branded the
Maoists as “anti-government forces” and suspected their intentions,
the Maoists had retained King Mahendra’s policy of maintaining
equidistance with both India and China, which the former Prime
Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) had defined as “non-
alignment”, and remaining neutral. This policy has also been followed
by the succeeding coalition government led by the Communist Party
of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML). The Maoists have
even gone a step further and projected India as an enemy state. In their
political resolutions, India has been designated as an interfering
neighbour and China as a benign power.36
36 The UCPN (Maoist) party, until its split on 18 June 2012, identified India as
its “principal enemy”. While the new faction called the CPN-Maoist (Baidya
faction) has been identifying India as its “principal enemy”, the UCPN (Maoist)
has changed its political line and the so-called “class enemy” by not branding
India as its enemy in the Hetauda convention in February 2013. For details

While China was looking for a reliable political force, which could
offer political stability in Nepal in the absence of the monarchy, the
Maoists’ policy helped it to push forward its strategic and economic
policies. However, political parties in general, and Maoists in particular,
have contradicted their own declared equidistance policy. During their
private and official visits, these leaders have reiterated the continuation
of strong bilateral relations with India as, for example, Prachanda’s
statements during his official visit to India in September 2008. Baburam
Bhattarai, the then Vice Chairman of the Maoist party, in an interview
to this author in June 2009, said: “[T]the equidistance policy is just a
party decision to satisfy our neighbours. In reality, we are more
dependent on India than China.”37
NEPAL AND MULTILATERALISM
India’s neighbours, including Nepal, on many occasions have branded
it as an interventionist power. This perception has emanated mostly
due to historical issues, regime incompatibility as well as multiple
asymmetries between India and its neighbours. These neighbours have
been adopting certain policy measures to overcome what they see as
their disadvantaged position. They resort to strategies like multilateral
diplomacy, seeking the help of external forces and multilateral agencies,
ganging up against India for reducing its influence in the region by
forming regional organisations like SAARC, and portraying India as a
hegemonic power.38

Nepal has, on many occasions, successfully utilised multilateral forums
and the UN to neutralise and minimise the influence of neighbouring
countries in its internal matters. For example, Nepal was a founding
member of both the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and SAARC.
In both these multilateral arrangements, Nepal has successfully raised
the concerns of small states and sought to establish that it is not
influenced by any country; that being a sovereign country, it has created
a space for itself at the international level. According to Muchkund
Dubey, Nepal and Bhutan, with the “support of other smaller member
countries, have used the SAARC forum to put pressure on India to
provide transit through the Indian territory to trade with Bangladesh,
and to the ports of Chittagong and Mongla for their trade with other
countries.”39 Pakistan and extra-regional powers have taken advantage
of Nepal’s India phobia.
Nepal and United Nations
Nepal has achieved its national objective more through multilateral
forums than through bilateral relations. Therefore, it always emphasises
the UN’s role in ensuring collective security. Nepal joined the UN in
December 1955 at a time when the sub-continent was witnessing some
major geo-political readjustments. There was a fear of Chinese
aggression towards the Himalayan kingdom. It must be remembered
that Mao Zedong had claimed Chinese dominance over Tibet and the
Himalayas in 1950.40 Moreover, the ruling class of Nepal did not feel
secure from possible external intervention despite the 1950 Treaty with
India, more so after India’s defeat in the Sino-India War of 1962. This
was also the period when Nepal strove for an independent foreign
policy beyond its neighbours. Its first effort to become a UN member
in May 1949 was thwarted by Soviet allegations that its independence
and sovereignty was compromised by the 1923 Treaty between Nepal
39 Ibid., p. 59.

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 31
and British India. The country joined the UN as a symbol of
international recognition of its sovereignty.41
Nepal’s leaders, while addressing the world community in the UN
General Assembly (UNGA), have expressed the view that joining the
UN was a strategic move for Nepal to safeguard its independence
and territorial integrity. From Nepal’s point of view, the UN is the
ultimate platform to raise the concerns of small states. This could be
one of the reasons why Nepal often tries to have friendly relations
with China and the US. Addressing the UNGA in 2011, former Prime
Minister Baburam Bhattarai said: “The General Assembly is the voice
of the voiceless of the world.”42 In the UN, Nepal has been focusing
on the plight of the small countries. In the post-monarchy period, in its
Interim Constitution of 2007, Nepal reiterated its commitment to
support the UN at various levels. Then Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha said at the 67th
session of the UNGA held on 28 September 2012:
While every country has the legitimate right to pursue its
enlightened national interests … the wider respect and observance
of the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, political
independence and non-interference are the bedrock principles
of international relations. These principles cannot and should
not be made subject to political test under any circumstances.
Shrestha also argued that given the global political scenario, “the UN
must ensure that it works for the advancement of the world’s poorest
and most vulnerable countries.”43

Under the new Constitution, which was adopted in September 2015,
Nepal has expressed its commitment to formulate its foreign policy
based on the Charter of the United Nations. Guided by the new
Constitution, while addressing the 75th session of UNGA in September
2020, Prime Minister Oli reiterated Nepal’s faith in the UN system. He
said “Nepal reposes enduring faith in multilateralism with the United
Nations at the centre. We [Nepal] underline the need to reform the
UN Security Council to make it more representative, transparent,
democratic, and accountable. The principle of sovereign equality must
remain at the core of all reform initiatives.”44 In the post-Constitution
period, the left government in Kathmandu led by PM Oli has been
asking for “sovereign equality” in the bilateral relations too.
United Nations Mission in Nepal
Nepal’s faith and reliability on multilateralism and UN was proved
when Nepalese leaders preferred the UN to play key role in monitoring
the peace process after the peace agreement was signed between the
Maoists and the seven-party alliance (SPA) in November 2006. Despite
India’s significant role in concluding the 12-point agreement in
November 2005 and its support to the Jan Andolan II, the Nepalese
leaders did not consider India as a neutral observer of the peace process.
They were apprehensive that this task of monitoring the peace process
would increase India’s intervention in Nepal. Interestingly, it was
reported that the Nepali Congress (NC) and the CPN-UML leaders
proposed the UN as a deal-maker, suspecting India to be sympathetic
towards the Maoists.45 They wanted India to use its good offices

45 On 24 July 2006, Prachanda wrote to the UN Secretary-General, “…the letter
[of 2 July 2006] was written and sent unilaterally and secretively without any
consultation with us [the Maoists] in utter violation of the spirit of ongoing
negotiation between the Government of Nepal and the CPN (Maoist).”

informally to support the successful completion of peace process; at
the same time, leaders of major political parties strove for a consensus
among themselves in favour of UN role in monitoring the peace
process. The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) was thus
invited to monitor the peace process, including integration of former
Maoist combatants into the Nepali Army.
Nepal and UN Programmes
Other than reposing its faith on UN system, Nepal has been consistently
contributing towards various UN programmes like peace keeping,
climate change and protecting rights of the landlocked developing
countries (LLDC). Since 1955, it has been an active participant of
most UN peace operations. The Nepal Army (NA) has participated in
over 43 UN missions and contributed over 1,32,524 personnel. The
role of Nepali keeping forces in conflict zones for restoring peace,
stability, and normalcy has been appreciated internationally.46
Nepal utilised the UN platform to flag its constraints as an LLDC
with the support of other landlocked countries. Nepal has also been
Bureau Member of the Group of the Landlocked Developing
Countries (LLDCs) in 2010–12. In view of the increasing debt burden
of the LDCs and LLDCs, Nepal has been demanding the easing—or,
wherever possible, writing off—of such debts. It also supported the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and expressed the
belief that this initiative should be extended to LDCs as well.47 Nepal
as an LLDC articulated its view that grant of transit by any country is
not a “favour” but is a right affirmed by the principles of international
law and practice.48

Demanding central role of UN for LLDCs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha,
then foreign minister of Nepal, pointed out at the 67th session of the
UNGA in 2012, that the least developed countries and landlocked
developing countries, as well as other vulnerable groups of countries
need special attention.49 Later, while delivering a statement on behalf
of Nepal at the 11th Annual Ministerial Meeting of the LLDCs in
New York on 26 September 2012, Shrestha said that the implementation
of the Almaty Programme of Action is a must to help LLDCs
overcome their inherent geographical difficulties and provide them
with support to eradicate poverty and hunger, achieve sustained
economic growth and facilitate better integration into the world
economy through increased flow of trade and investment.50
NEPAL AND LDCS
Nepal also assumed a distinctive identity in the UN by seeking more
global attention for the LDCs. According to a publication of Nepal’s
Foreign Ministry, as chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs,
a position Nepal obtained in September 2009:
Nepal…urged for the effective partnership between LDCs and
their development partners in order to achieve the goals set by
the Millennium Summit for development and poverty reduction.
Nepal has also taken the position that the debt burden of the
LDCs should be written off; the commitments of donors to
allocate 0.15–0.20 per cent of GNP as official development
assistance (ODA) to LDCs should be fulfilled; and duty-free and
quota-free access be given to the markets of the developed
countries for the exports of LDCs.51

Nepal has also been supporting the shared interests of LDCs in the
UN and other important regional and multilateral forums since it took
over the responsibility of chairmanship of LDCs Global Coordination
Bureau in September 2009.52
As political situation improved in Nepal in the post-conflict period,
the democratically elected governments needed more foreign funds/
FDI and technology to address people’s aspirations like infrastructure
development, job opportunities, industrialisation, and good governance.
Nepal attempted to graduate from the LDC status to a developing
country with an objective of receiving more foreign investments and
acquiring a new status at the international level. In this regard, in 2015
Nepal requested UN to consider it for graduation from the LDC
status. One media report indicated that in the last two triennial reviews
conducted in 2015 and 2018, Nepal could meet two of the three
criteria related to human asset index and economic vulnerability index.
It had failed to meet the per capita income criterion. The Committee
for Development Policy under the United Nations Economic and Social
Council will review Nepal’s case in 2021. The policy makers in Nepal
are in dilemma about meeting the per capita income criterion in the
COVID-19 situation. The Nepal Human Development Report 2020:
Beyond LDC Graduation—Productive Transformation and Prosperity suggested
reviewing of Nepal’s graduation process due to devastating impact of
COVID-19 on Nepal’s economy. “The COVID-19 pandemic may
have profound impacts on the graduation criteria…All of these factors
may require a fresh review of the scheduled graduation plan while
developing a transition strategy.”53 Earlier, Nepal had requested UN
agencies for postponement of graduation considering the impact of
earthquake in 2015.

NEPAL AND NAM
After UN, Nepal has given priority to NAM and its principles, which
figures strongly in its approach towards other countries. It also helps
Nepal maintain a balance between its two neighbours and assert its
sovereignty and independence. Nepal has been one of the founding
members of NAM. King Mahendra had participated at the Afro–
Asian Conference in Bandung, Indonesia in April 1955, which marked
Nepal’s entry into the international organisations other than the UN.
The concept of NAM evolved to create a separate identity for the
Afro-Asian countries at the international level that had painful history
of being colonised by European countries. They were apprehensive
about being colonised again by taking side between the then two
superpowers that had divided the world into two blocks. These
countries also wanted to send out a message to the developed countries
that a cooperative framework might protect them against exploitation
and interventions by the dominant global powers.
It is worth noting that Nepal was never a colony. Despite that, it took
a leading role in promoting NAM broadly due to four reasons. First,
King Mahendra was unsure about the intentions of India and China
towards adhering to territorial integrity and sovereignty of Nepal. This
insecurity emanated from India’s support towards democratic forces
and pushing for maintaining a special relationship as per the Treaty of
Peace and Friendship signed in 1950. Second, in 1955, King Mahendra
wanted to get rid of India’s intervention in internal matters of Nepal.
Bandung Conference gave Nepal a platform to reposition itself as a
sovereign, independent, and a neutral country since the international
community was under the impression that Nepal could not formulate
its foreign policy independently due to its 1950 Treaty with India. Third,
the formation of NAM coincided with King Mahendra’s policy of
diversifying foreign policy to maintain strategic autonomy. Nepal’s
NAM membership had helped to demilitarise its territory by ousting
Indian military missions and check-posts.54 One Nepali scholar observed
that “with regards to Nepal whose geography is both a challenge and
54 Ibid.

an asset depending on how tactfully we balance our bilateral relations
with India and China, adherence to NAM can be our effective tool of
strategic autonomy.”55 Four, NAM provided a platform for Nepal to
express concerns which it could not at the bilateral levels. Moreover,
from Nepal’s point of view, NAM was a message to its neighbours to
prevent them from pressurising Nepal to gang-up against other
countries. According to Kirti Nidi Bista, former Prime Minister of
Nepal, by joining NAM Nepal wanted to send “a message to various
countries that Nepal would never involve itself in bilateral conflicts or
wars by pitting one against the other (India versus China, or India
versus Pakistan), which was honoured at the time.”56
Since the Bandung Conference, Nepal has consistently argued in favour
of strengthening NAM. The importance of NAM for Nepal was
once again apparent when Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai ignored
the advice of some Western diplomats to not attend the 16th NAM
summit in Tehran in August 2012. Addressing the Tehran summit,
Bhattarai appealed to the member countries to make “NAM a voice
for the voiceless and power for the powerless and asking to make a
pledge to work in a coherent, cooperative and concerted manner for
justice and peace at home and more importantly for justice and peace
in the world.”57
The first elected government of Nepal under the new Constitution
reiterated significance of NAM. Before leaving for the 18th NAM
summit, in an interview to National News Agency and Nepal Television,
Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said there was a consensus

at the ministerial meeting of NAM that “NAM is linked with our
significance and development, which is why our foreign policy is based
on the principles of the non-aligned movement and given our geo-
political situation non-alignment, neutrality and non-intervention,
sovereign equality are very important. It’s an opportunity for Nepal to
reaffirm its commitment to NAM principles”.58
Prime Minister Oli had led a 21-member Nepali delegation to the 18th
NAM summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 25–26 October 2019. The
presence of a large delegation, including PM and foreign minister in
the Baku summit, indicated relevance of NAM to Nepal. Addressing
the summit on 25 October 2019, Prime Minister Oli suggested that
Nepal visualises a NAM that is “internally cohesive, united, strong and
externally influential so that entrenched global inequalities are uprooted
for once and for all.”59
NEPAL AND SAARC
At the regional level, Nepal played a key role in the formation of
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). As a
founding member, Nepal has been firmly committed to making SAARC
a dynamic regional organisation. While the UN and NAM took care
of Nepal’s strategic and diplomatic needs, SAARC provided a platform
for its economic interests.60 Unlike NAM, Nepal used SAARC mostly

to negotiate with India in a group, which it could not do bilaterally.
There were occasions when Nepal along with other SAARC members
tried to put pressure on India for sharing of river waters, dams and
other economic issues and also tried to reduce India’s influence by
recommending the inclusion of extra-regional powers as observers.
For example, at the 13th SAARC summit in Dhaka in November 2005,
Nepal and Pakistan proposed China as an observer to counter India’s
proposal to offer membership to Afghanistan. It is believed that
Gyanendra wanted to neutralise India’s influence at the domestic and
regional level. He suspected India of having designs to mobilise the
Maoists against the monarchy.61
Nepal successfully conducted the 18th SAARC summit in November
2014. The Kathmandu summit focused on past issues like terrorism,
climate change, regional connectivity and a common market. However,
it also came up with some fresh agendas such as launching of a regional
communication satellite, railway services, SAARC motor vehicles
agreement and energy cooperation in South Asia. Other issues included
making concerted efforts and cooperation to contain communicable
diseases such as Ebola, HIV/AIDS, etc. The Kathmandu Summit re-
emphasised “the relevant bodies/mechanisms for effective
implementation of the SAARC Agreement on Rapid Response to
Natural Disasters, SAARC Convention on Cooperation on
Environment and Thimpu Statement on Climate Change, including
taking into account the existential threats posed by climate change to
some SAARC member states.”62
However, the fate of the Kathmandu summit once again dismayed
the people of this region and the international community. The summit
ended with signing of only the SAARC framework agreement on
energy cooperation (electricity). The summit had earlier proposed to

ratify the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA) and Regional Railways Agreement
(RRA). Both the proposals were initiated by India. “Pakistan had
expressed reservations over three pacts that were expected to be signed
during the summit.”63 Despite the initial enthusiasm of some
improvement in India–Pakistan relations after Pakistan PM Nawaz
Sharif attended the oath taking ceremony of PM Modi, the firings on
the LoC and the cancellation of foreign secretary level talks, just before
the Kathmandu summit, once again affected the SAARC meeting. As
a result, the leaders were reluctant to recognise each other’s presence
during the inaugural session of the summit. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala
played a crucial role in trying to break the stalemate between the two
leaders during a retreat at Dhulikhel on the sidelines of the summit.
Pakistan opposed India’s proposal on MVA and rail agreement and
later agreed to sign on the Nepal-backed energy proposal.
The 19th SAARC summit, which was supposed to be held in Islamabad,
was cancelled due to Pakistani sponsored terrorist group’s attack on an
Indian Army camp in Uri, Kashmir. Bangladesh, Bhutan, and
Afghanistan had condemned the attack and supported India’s decision
to stay away from the summit citing cross-border terrorist attacks in
the region. Interestingly, Nepal did not condemn the attack in Uri. It
only officially (as SAARC chair) cancelled the 19th SAARC summit
since four countries declared their unwillingness to participate.64 As
one of the signatories of SAARC regional convention on suppression
of terrorism and as a friendly neighbour, India expected Nepal’s
support at that crucial juncture. Rather, Nepal insisted on holding the
summit in Islamabad. In September 2020, Foreign Minister of Nepal,

SAARC Foreign Ministers had urged the member states to explore all
viable options to hold the 19th summit at an early date. In the same
meeting, Pakistan expressed its willingness to hold the summit. Once
again, while other SAARC members expressed inability to hold the
19th SAARC summit due to COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal supported
Pakistan’s proposal during the virtual meeting held in September 2020.65
The same was reiterated by PM Oli on the occasion of the 36th Charter
Day of SAARC. PM Oli appealed for “giving fresh impetus to the
stalled SAARC process including through the early convening of the
Summit”.66 Most importantly, while there is no change in Pakistan’s
position in supporting cross-border terrorism and terror financing,
Nepal’s tacit support to Pakistan on the SAARC summit has been a
subject of concern to New Delhi.
NEPAL AND BIMSTEC
Nepal is also a part of BIMSTEC and regional initiatives like the Asian
Highway and Asian railway networks. Though not a founding member
of the BIMSTEC, Nepal decided to join it in 1997 and was given the
observer status on 19 December 1998. Due to a five-year moratorium
set in 1997 on the consideration of applications for new membership,
Nepal was granted full membership only in 2003. Since then, Nepal
has been actively participating in various meetings of BIMSTEC.67

Nepal joined BIMSTEC for rapid economic growth and also due to
the slow progress in the SAARC. Secondly, joining BIMSTEC would
help Nepal improve its economic cooperation with the member
countries and take advantage of connectivity and poverty alleviation
programmes. Interestingly, it is the first member of BIMSTEC which
does not have direct access to sea, and depends on India and Bangladesh
for that. Nepal has been demanding special facilities for landlocked
countries in the BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Lastly, as
discussed earlier, being a small country, Nepal believes that
multilateralism would help in addressing the concerns of the LDCs on
economic issues. In 2005, Bangladesh and Nepal disagreed on India’s
proposal over the rules of origin (ROO) issue and both demanded
that the LDCs in the BIMSTEC should be allowed a “less stringent
value addition norm”.68
Nepal hosted the 4th BIMSTEC summit in Kathmandu on 30–31
August 2018. The summit recognised the special needs and
circumstances of the least developed and landlocked developing
countries and required sustained efforts and cooperation and
comprehensive approach involving active participation and
collaboration of the member states against terrorism and transnational
organised crimes. Based on this declaration, unofficially, New Delhi
had proposed to the member countries to hold a joint military exercise
to share its experience in counter-insurgency, terrorism and disaster
management. Quoting one unanimous Indian official, some media
reports said “participation depended entirely on the comfort level of
participating countries”69 and Nepal had reportedly agreed to participate

in the exercise. Interestingly, just over a week after Kathmandu summit,
Nepal withdrew from the exercise citing internal political pressure.
India expressed its displeasure to Nepal diplomatically over its decision
because “The Indian position is this was something in the works for a
while. Nepal had agreed. A planning meeting was held much earlier.
PM Modi mentioned it in his speech in Kathmandu in front of
everyone on August 30.”70
The strategic community in India believed that Nepal withdrew from
the military exercise under the pressure from China and not due to
internal political pressure. This impression was deduced from two
bilateral developments between Nepal and China. The first event was
the Nepal Army’s media briefing on 11 September 2018, about holding
the second joint military exercise with China, Sagarmatha Friendship-
2, from 17 to 28 September in Chengdu. This declaration happened
interestingly after Nepal’s decision to withdraw from BIMSTEC military
exercise. The second event was after a meeting with Chinese delegation
in Kathmandu, Nepal’s Commerce Ministry on 7 September 2018
confirmed that “Nepal and China finalised a protocol during a meeting
in Kathmandu giving Nepal access to the Chinese ports at Tianjin,
Shenzhen, Lianyungang and Zhanjiang.”71
Despite this, Nepal continues to be committed towards strengthening
BIMSTEC. Nepal is a lead country in implementing BIMSTEC Poverty
Plan of Action (PPA) which was endorsed in the Second Ministerial
Meeting held in Kathmandu in 2012. Nepal will benefit economically
under connectivity network specially connecting the sea routes. From
its limited access to sea ports, Nepal will have multiple sea port
connectivity options under BIMSTEC programme. Since Nepal is not

inland connectivity will fill up that gap and promote Buddhist tourists

NEPAL’S FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE INTERIM
CONSTITUTION
Although Nepal’s Interim Constitution (IC) followed the foreign policy
parameters of the 1990 Constitution, it was slightly modified in view
of the peace and constitution making process, the objective of its
foreign policy being to “enhance the dignity of Nepal in the international
arena by maintaining the sovereignty, integrity and independence of
the country.”72 Nepal’s foreign policy was based on the basic principles
of international laws and norms such as:
1. Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty;
2. Non-interference in each other’s internal affairs;
3. Respect for mutual equality;
4. Non-aggression and peaceful settlement of disputes; and
5. Cooperation for mutual benefit.73
According to Article 26 (15, 16) of the 2007-Interim Constitution, the
foreign policy of Nepal was to be guided by the principles of the UN
Charter, non-alignment, Panchsheel, international law, world peace along
with continuous efforts to ensure peace for Nepal through international
recognition, by promoting cooperation and good relations with other
countries in economic, social and other spheres on the basis of equality.
72 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Nepal. See http://
www.mofa.gov.np/foreignpolicy/
73 Ibid.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 45
The IC also provided for ratification and approval of previous treaties
and agreements in Parliament. According to Article 156(2):
The laws to be made pursuant to clause (1) shall, inter alia, require
that the ratification of, accession to, acceptance of or approval
of treaty or agreements on the following subjects be done by a
two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the
Legislature-Parliament existing:
(a) peace and friendship;
(b) security and strategic alliance;
(c) the boundaries of Nepal; and
(d) natural resources and the distribution of their uses.
Article 156(4) says that “Notwithstanding anything contained in clauses
(1) and (2), no treaty or agreement shall be concluded that may be
detrimental to the territorial integrity of Nepal.”
FOREIGN POLICY IN POST-MONARCHY PERIOD
From August 2008 to September 2014,74 Nepal had five
governments—the UCPN-Maoist and CPN-UML both leading two
of each. Foreign policy of Nepal during that period was guided by
IC. There has been a perception in Nepal that India was sympathetic
to the governments of Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai.
It may be noted that India’s bids were ignored for most of the mega
projects in Nepal during these two regimes. For example, the machine-
readable passport project was given to France by Madhav Kumar
Nepal’s government. Three mega projects—Lumbini and Pokhara
airports and West Seti hydro project—went to Chinese companies
during Baburam’s premiership. Also, while Indian companies75 were
74 Baburam Bhattarai, elected in August 2011, was the fourth Prime Minister
of Nepal after the CA elections.
75 The list of Indian joint ventures or companies, whose business was affected
adversely in Nepal were: Surya Nepal (Garment), Nepal Lever, Manipal Medical,
GMR (hydro), ITC Surya, Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (holding expansion plan),
and Soaltee Hotels Limited.
46 | NIHAR R. NAYAK
facing difficulties in operating in the hydro, garment, hotel and
infrastructure sectors in Nepal on account of the unfavourable business
environment in the country, Chinese companies started investing in
those sectors. All the four governments, instead of striving to enhance
the dignity of Nepal in the international arena, tilted towards China to
neutralise the perceived Indian influence prompted by party ideology
and individual agendas.
UCPN (Maoist) led Government
There have been major changes in Nepal’s foreign policy outlook since
the Maoists assumed power in August 2008. The Federal Democratic
Republic of Nepal has emphasised independence in the conduct of its
foreign policy. The Maoist government adapted the “equidistance
policy” into a policy of “non-alignment” and neutrality. The practical
application of that was, instead of feeding the people of Humla with
Indian rice transported by helicopter from Nepalganj, the government
would get rice from the nearby markets in Tibet.76 Prachanda, the then
Prime Minister, visited Beijing in August 2008 to attend the concluding
ceremony of the Olympic Games, departing from the tradition of a
new Nepali PM officially visiting New Delhi first. In April 2009, China
proposed a revised peace and friendship treaty with Nepal to improve
its own standing in that country. Prachanda, however, cancelled the
visit scheduled for May 2009. Earlier, China was more focused on the
Tibet issue, but it diversified its interests in Nepal being encouraged by

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 47
the Maoists’ policy of maintaining equidistance with India and China.
One Nepalese scholar has observed that:
The new trend evident over the past three years [since 2008]
now has China’s interest in Nepal shifting from being almost
exclusively focused on Tibet-related security issues (essentially
preventing any “Free Tibet” activity out of Nepal) to being part
of Beijing’s larger geo-strategic plan for South Asia.77
On the other hand, the UCPN-Maoist, which had not abandoned its
“revolutionary political objective”, was eager to seek China’s support
to counterbalance India. To oblige China, the Prachanda government
took strong action against the Tibetan refugee movement in Nepal
and increased border security to prevent transit of Tibetan refugees
across the border with China.
Several high-level visits have been exchanged between China and the
Maoist government in Nepal. These included Prime Minister
Prachanda’s trip to Beijing in September 2008, followed by the visit of
Defence Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa a few days later. China’s Foreign
Minister Yang Jiechi visited Nepal in December 2008. During Thapa’s
visit in September 2008, China agreed to provide security assistance
worth $2.61 million to Nepal and the agreement was signed on 7
December 2008.78 China also agreed to provide technical assistance
for the merger of the Maoist armed cadres with the Nepal Army, and
economic assistance worth NPRs 1.2 billion to support Nepal’s
infrastructure and technical development.

Like the kings in the past, the democratic governments since 2008
sought to reduce India’s influence in Nepal, with the Maoists (before
the split) even projecting India as an enemy state in their manifesto.
Maoist demands mentioned therein are: (i) regulated or closed border,
(ii) more trade and transit facilities, (iii) formation of Greater Nepal,
(iv) civilian nuclear units with the help from China, (v) demarcation of
borders, and (vi) diversification of trade and free arms import.
Although Prachanda undertook the first official visit to India, his first
foreign trip to Beijing had indicated that the Maoists would prefer
China over India. During his visit to the Nordic countries in March
2009, Prachanda articulated the view that sustainable peace was not
possible in Nepal without economic prosperity and support from the
international community. He requested Norway to invest in
hydropower development and other sectors of mutual interest.79 Even
after his resignation, the Maoists mobilised international support to
come back to power and projected India as an interventionist power.
When the Maoists returned to power for the second time with Baburam
Bhattarai as prime minister in August 2011, he restored the tradition
of making the first official visit to India at the invitation of India’s
prime minister. While articulating Nepal’s foreign policy priorities in
the changing global and regional order, he said that Nepal needs to
reorient its foreign policy and become a “vibrant bridge” between the
two Asian economic giants. In this regard, road and rail connections
between Tibet and India through Nepal needed to be augmented. He
noted that the “country’s focus on India, China and US will be
instrumental in developing Nepal.”80 Despite the UCPN-Maoists’

declared policy of equidistance, Bhattarai believed that Nepal is
economically more dependent on India than China. However, given
the growing presence of China in Nepal, it could be a major challenge
for Nepal to maintain a balance between the two neighbours. While
earlier India had a major share in the Nepalese economy and
investments, the situation has become more competitive for India since
2013. Both countries exert pressure on Nepal if it enters into any
agreement with the other. There is also domestic pressure to maintain
a balance in the relationship. For example, after the conclusion of BIPA
(Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement) between
Nepal and India, there was pressure both from China and the UCPN-
Maoist party on Nepal to enter into a similar agreement with China. In
an effort to maintain a balance in hydro projects in Nepal, the Interim
Constitution’s directive on foreign policy was ignored—for the first
time in the last four years—by allotting the West Seti project to China.
There has been a constant demand from the radical Maoist factions to
allocate more hydro and infrastructure projects of Nepal to China to
neutralise India’s influence.
However, given the controversies related to the West Seti project and
the delay in the process, China sensed a conspiracy. These doubts
emanated from Nepali media stories that Baburam Bhattarai
government was supported by India. This perception was strengthened
further when Bhattarai told the media in advance about Chinese Prime
Minister Wen Jiabao’s visit to Nepal in December 2011. Perhaps, the
Chinese establishment was apprehensive about protests/demonstrations
by Tibetan refugees in Nepal during the Premier’s visit. As a result, the
visit was postponed to January 2012. Moreover, China has never been
comfortable with a pro-India regime in Nepal. It has the impression
that the regime might not take strong action against Tibetan refugees in
Nepal. Since China had limited options of replacing the Baburam
Bhattarai government, it expressed its displeasure by not responding
positively to the Nepal government’s request to meet Wen Jiabao on
the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development at Rio in June 2012. The message was repeated thereafter
when China reportedly facilitated Netra Bikram Chand’s visits to China
before the split in the UCPN-Maoist in June 2012 and during an
50 | NIHAR R. NAYAK
unofficial visit of Ai Ping.81 During his visit, surprisingly, Ai Ping did
not meet the prime minister. Although China claimed that it was against
the split in UCPN-Maoist, surprisingly, it did not put pressure on the
Baidya faction to merge with the parent party during Baidya’s China
visit in July 2012. Rather, China acknowledged that the CPN-Maoist
party was a “nationalist force”.82
Since the Maoists’ declared “equidistance” policy had been a non-starter
because of both the domestic situation in Nepal and the regional power
balance between India and China, the Maoists had moderated their
policy by emphasising on economic and development programmes
with a fresh proposal of “trilateral cooperation” between Nepal–India–
China. The proposal came from the UCPN (Maoist) Chairman, Pushpa
Kamal Dahal, on 26 October, after his five-day visit for attending the
Shanghai Expo 2010.83 The proposal was reiterated by Dahal after
signing a MoU with Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation (APEC)
Foundation on 7 November 2012 for the Lumbini development project
and again during his official visits to Beijing and New Delhi in April
2013. India was lukewarm about the proposal even before Dahal could
formally discuss with Indian decision makers. Sensing India’s negative
response, Dahal modified his proposal during an interaction with Indian
intellectuals at ICWA on 29 April 2013 and said that “trilateral
cooperation in various mutual projects in Nepal is very much possible.
It is our vision for the future. Let me also clarify that by no means do

In the same meeting, Dahal also emphasised that a prosperous and
developed Nepal can manage the security concerns of the region
effectively. Interestingly, India did not respond to the proposal.
CPN-UML led Government
The Maoist policy of equidistance was also followed by the succeeding
coalition government led by Madhav Kumar Nepal of the CPN-UML,
but with some moderation in policies vis-à-vis India. The new prime
minister visited India soon after assuming office. Interestingly, his visit
to Beijing in December 2009 was a high-profile one and the two
countries agreed to further strengthen their relationship. Since this was
the first official visit of the Nepali prime minister to China after it
became a Republic, China took the visit very seriously. One of the
longest and most detailed joint statements was issued at the end of
that visit. The two countries agreed to “lift their bilateral relationship to
a higher level by establishing a comprehensive partnership of
cooperation,”85 which hinted at taking the relationship to a higher level
from the previous “good-neighbourly partnership” to “closer ties
between China and Nepal”. China’s top legislator Wu Bangguo,86 during
an interaction with Nepal, clarified that the objective of the
comprehensive partnership was “strategic”. The joint statement further
widened the window of opportunities for China in Nepal.

Madhav Kumar Nepal’s successor, Jhalanath Khanal, further facilitated
Chinese presence in Nepal. One scholar observed: “Although both
Madhav Nepal and Prime Minister Khanal belong to the same party,
the CPN-UML, the latter, who became prime minister through a secret
deal with Maoist Chairman Dahal, is perceived more positively by
Beijing.”87 During this period, several Chinese political and business
delegations visited Nepal. Surprisingly, in his 15 months’ tenure, Khanal
did not undertake any official visits to Nepal’s two important
neighbours.
NC and UML Coalition Government
The Nepali Congress (NC) led new coalition government formed
after the CA elections in November 2013 continued the previous
government’s foreign policy (equidistance policy between India and
China and fighting for LDCs’ cause) and also in accordance to the IC.
However, the new government tried to utilise various tools of
diplomacy to take advantage of economic growth of India and China
“beyond the mere rhetoric of ‘being a bridge’ between these two
economies and act to translate our vision into reality”. Taking into
consideration Nepal’s “structural constraints”, the government’s foreign
policy objective was utilising diplomacy to generate resources, especially
attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), for domestic socio-economic
transformation and development by modernising foreign policy related
institutions.88
Keeping faith in its southern neighbour, which was not the case during
the first phase of Maoist government and the UML, Prime Minister
Sushil Koirala paid an official visit to Delhi during 25–28 May 2014 on
the invitation of PM-designate Narendra Modi, to attend the oath

taking ceremony along with other SAARC leaders. The invite from
India perhaps gave a relief to the NC and PM Koirala because China
invited the PM to attend the inaugural ceremony of the Second China–
South Asia Exposition at Kunming from 6–10 June 2014. Nepal was
chosen as “Country of Honour” for the Expo 2014. Foreign Minister
Mahendra Pandey’s statement on the PM’s visit to India reflected that it
seemed PM Koirala did not want to visit China first by breaking the
tradition of undertaking the first official visit to Delhi. The statement
said “Koirala’s India visit has paved the way for his sojourn to Kunming,
China, for the second China–South Asia Trade Exposition. The deck
has been cleared for the PM to visit China once he returns from India
respecting Nepal’s long-standing tradition of visiting India first.”89
Koirala’s visit to China in June was the third visit of a Head of the
government to that country in the post-Monarchy period and the visit
happened after around five years of PM Madhav Kumar Nepal’s visit
to Beijing in December 2009.
The neighbourhood has been the prime focus of PM Koirala’s foreign
policy. While committing to address the security concerns of the two
neighbours, the government also expected its neighbours to respect its
geo-political sensitivities. Articulating Nepal’s foreign policy during the
political transition period and changing geo-political dynamics in Asia
and at the international level, PM Koirala said “Nepal’s foreign policy
priority begins with its neighbours, India and China. We immensely
value our relations with them.”90
Like previous regimes, this government also maintained very good
relations with other countries and multilateral organisations. Some of
the major foreign policy achievements of the Koirala government were:

THE NEW FOREIGN POLICY
Since Nepal became a federal, democratic, secular republic, the
parliamentary committee on the International Relations and Human
Rights recommended that Nepal’s foreign policy be updated in the
changed context. It said Bhutanese, Tibetans and other refugees are a
burden on Nepal, and that Nepal should send them back with respect,
through bilateral and multilateral diplomatic channels. Tibetan refugees
should be allowed to stay on but on the condition that they would not
indulge in anti-China activities, which would affect Nepal’s commitment
to the one-China policy. The report further said that the scope of
Nepal’s foreign policy should be diversified to support the economic
and social development of the country. Nepal should also remain

committed to international organisations like the UN, World Bank,
IMF, ADB, WTO, etc.92
Keeping in mind the shifts in internal and external situation, the new
Constitution (2015) guides the new foreign policy of Nepal to be
adopted on the following lines: Article 5 says “Safeguarding of the
freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationality, independence and
dignity of Nepal, the rights of the Nepalese people, border security,
economic wellbeing, and prosperity shall be the basic elements of the
national interest of Nepal.”
Likewise Article 51 (m) (1) of the Constitution guides Nepal to “conduct
an independent foreign policy based on the Charter of the UN, non-
alignment, principles of Panchsheel…remaining active in safeguarding
the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and national interest
of Nepal”. Moreover, Section (2) of the same article advised the State
to “review treaties concluded in the past, and make treaties, agreements
based on equality and mutual interest”.93 It would be worth mentioning
here that as of September 2015, Nepal has maximum number of
treaties and agreements with India, including the most controversial
“1950 Treaty”. The objective of this section could be to revise and
update the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship with India. The issue
has been a contentious issue between the two countries for a long
time. Apart from that, many agreements between India and Nepal on
water and hydropower could be updated or revised in the changing
situation. There has been a perception amongst the people in Nepal
that these treaties have not benefitted the country much. The new
Constitution also directs the Union Government to ensure “Abiding
and Protecting the sovereignty, unity, national sovereignty (or national
independence) and national interest; conduct independent foreign policy
based on United Nations Charter, Non-Alignment, Panchsheel
Agreement, International Law and Global Peace.” This indicates that

being a small and landlocked state, the core of Nepal’s foreign policy
would be to focus on protecting its territorial integrity and identity,
and mobilise international support in case of any threat to its sovereignty.
Both political and economic diplomacy would be utilised to achieve
national interest and national security.
Foreign Policy during Oli Government: Old Wine in New
Bottle?
After 57 years of political struggle for multi-party democracy, including
ten years of a Maoist insurgency, Nepal adopted the first democratic
Constitution in September 2015. The process formally ended the
monarchy, the Maoist conflict, and the prolonged debate over the new
Constitution, all of which had stalled economic growth and
infrastructure development in the country.
A strong new government in Kathmandu led by the Nepal Communist
Party (NCP) after 2017 parliamentary elections raised people’s
expectations that the country would finally move forward. There was
a realisation in the ruling party that the old style of foreign policy might
not address the developmental aspirations of the people and that it
should be updated as per the new provisions of the 2015-Constitution.94
After assuming power in April 2018, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli
indicated the need to adopt more independent and norms based foreign
policy. In May 2018, the NCP’s first policy and programme gave free
hand to the government to take “any domestic-international policy,
decision and play the role as an independent and free country. We
would believe in a good neighbourly relation with our both neighbouring
countries.” With this in mind, “our foreign relation will be based on
mutual benefit and respect, international commitment and duties, and
national interest and justice. Diplomatic missions will be made active
for national interest, tourism development, export, and attracting foreign
investment.”

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 57
In this regard, the Oli government formed a task force to provide
concrete suggestions and prepare a new foreign policy suitable to the
changed context of the world. In an interview to the media on 8
October 2020, Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said, “The
government is in final stage of drafting a new foreign policy of the
country that will transform Nepal’s geographic position between two
giant countries [India and China] as an opportunity for economic
development.”95 He was perhaps hinting about transforming Nepal
to a transit country between India and China by developing trans-
Himalayan connectivity and trade corridor.
In an effort to remove past perceptions about Nepal as investment
unfriendly country, the top business houses and government of Nepal
organised infrastructure conclaves (2017) and investment summit (2019)
in Kathmandu. A large number of foreign companies and leaders
participated in these mega events which drew large scale commitments.
China alone committed to invest $8.3 billion in Nepal in 2017.96 In
February 2020, Nepal also organised a tourism investment summit.
The Oli government formally announced the new foreign policy of
Nepal in December 2020. The policy broadly talks about Nepal’s
engagements with neighbours, major powers and its commitment
towards multilateral organisations such as the UN, SAARC, and NAM.
Most importantly, it has emphasised on diversifying economic policy
to attract more FDI and track-two diplomacy to resolve disputes and
amend bilateral treaties. For the first time, Nepal also laid emphasis on

thematic issues like climate change, labour migration and soft power
(Budhatwa) in its foreign policy.97
Except soft power and Budhatwa, Nepal has been practicing other
issues since 1955. Therefore, the new foreign policy appears like an old
wine in a new bottle. The Oli government has only prepared a
consolidated report while those issues were scattered earlier. Most
importantly, the operational aspect of foreign policy is important than
just having that on paper. As discussed earlier, small states have limited
capacity to operate their foreign policy against the system established
by the major powers. The manoeuvrability of the same diminishes
further for a landlocked country like Nepal, located between two major
powers.
Foreign Policy during Sher Bahadur Deuba
Irrespective of whether the CPN-UML is in power or the Nepali
Congress, the foreign policy of Nepal towards China has remained
unchanged, mostly due to geographical constraints. Nepal has been
adhering to the “one China policy” and not irritating or upsetting the
northern neighbour despite knowing the fact that there have been three
major border disputes98 with China. While taking the vote of confidence
on 18 July 2021, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said in the
Parliament that Nepal’s foreign policy will prioritise “neighbouring
countries” and then go on to include the region, the major powers of
the United States, and Europe and others. He also mentioned that
there are no permanent friends and enemies in foreign policy, and
international relations, but there is always a permanent interest. However,

the government emphasised securing vaccines as the first and foremost
priority in foreign policy.99
Other than King Mahendra, Deuba’s was the first democratically elected
government in Nepal that attempted to diversify and consolidate the
foreign policy beyond the core sector—India and China—by giving
due consideration to the contemporary domestic and regional
developments. Even after 70 years of diplomatic history, regime security
has remained a key determinant of Nepal’s foreign policy. The new
governments in Kathmandu give priority to win the goodwill of
neighbouring countries, especially India. However, in the post-
monarchy period, the search for resources and technology to address
domestic demands has been another prime factor that drives Nepal’s
foreign policy.
Interestingly, the common minimum programme (CMP)100, one of
the important policy documents of the ruling coalition of the political
parties, emphasised just opposite of what Prime Minister Deuba
articulated in the Parliament in the previous month. As reported in the
Nepali media, “the CMP underlined the need to resolve issues relating
to the Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulek region through diplomatic
means with India. The region was included in the national map of
Nepal following its endorsement by the federal Parliament last year.
The CMP underlined the need for Nepal to adopt a ‘Neighbours First’
policy while striking cordial relations with the other countries as well.”
It would be worth mentioning that the CMP did not mention Nepal’s
border disputes with China, especially in Humla, which was reported
by the party’s own members, Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, a member of
Karnali Provincial Assembly. After a field visit of border areas with

China, Shahi in October 2020 had submitted a report101 to the party
headquarters saying some parts of Nepal had been encroached upon
by China—Namkha Rural Municipality of Humla.102 Other than Shahi,
in the same year, other NC lawmakers Devendra Raj Kandel, Satya
Narayan Sharma Khanal and Sanjay Kumar Gautam had even registered
a resolution motion in the federal parliament claiming that China has
encroached Nepali land in Gorkha, Solukhumbu, Darchula, and Humla
districts.
The NC, then as the opposition party, had claimed that pillar no. 11
has been missing for years in the Lapcha area, where the Chinese
government has constructed buildings. That area was part of Nepal
earlier. The claim was made after a government team led by the then
Chief District Officer (CDO) of the Humla district, Chiranjivi Giri,
had gone for the field inspection at pillar no. 11 at the Nepal–China
border in September 2020. The party also later claimed that China has
ventured two kilometers inside in the Humla district and urged the
then K P Sharma Oli government to send a protest note to China.
It appears that Deuba-led ruling coalition government has given priority
to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China against the US-funded
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) programme. This policy
of the Deuba-led government has been criticised by some senior
leaders of the party. NC’s Vice-President Bimalendra Nidhi took
exception to exclusion of the US-funded MCC and border disputes
with China in the common minimum programme. Interestingly,
responding to Nidhi’s remarks, PM Deuba said “I tried to include the

7 (1) and 8 (1) were damaged and Pillar No. 12 was replaced with a new one.

of Nepali land has slipped into the Chinese territory.

CONCLUSION
Despite all these signs of progress in the post-Constitution period,
Nepal continues to remain an economically poor country in South
Asia and is dependent on its neighbours and other countries for aid
and growth. It suffers from poor infrastructure, especially internal
highways. Given the small size of its market, investors often look for
India’s support to export their products. For example, in hydro sector,
non-Indian companies seek assurances/guarantees from India for future
purchase of electricity due to easy access and large market.104 Most
importantly, many Nepalese products face sharp competition from
Indian and Chinese companies due to similarities in products. In that
regard, Nepal has been looking for an integrated market economy
with its neighbours or as a bridge between them to increase FDI inflow
and rapid economic growth. Nepal has thus often proposed trilateral
cooperation (TC)105 between Nepal, India, and China. Nepal wants to
regain its previous status as a transit economy between Tibet and India
by reviving old silk routes and connecting those with China’s flagship
BRI project.

Given the unfolding regional competition between China, the US, and
India, the new governments in Kathmandu have been attempting to
use the bargaining power to their advantage by drawing investments
from both their neighbours. Instead of that, in the three and a half
years, the K. P. Sharma Oli-led NCP government failed to attract
investments and initiate any major development projects like connectivity,
hydro energy, or any other infrastructure projects. Guided by party
ideology and public pressure to reduce dependency on India and
diversify its foreign investment options, initially, the Oli government in
Kathmandu maintained a distance from New Delhi. The NCP
government was more comfortable with China due to ideological
factors. Nepal and China had a number of MoUs and agreements
related to economic cooperation, transit trade investments, and others
mainly signed during PM Oli’s Beijing visits. Despite that, the much-
hyped nine development projects under the BRI did not progress
substantially. Rather, under pressure from China, Nepal delayed the
parliamentary approval of the much-needed $500 million development
assistance under the MCC programme due to intense division within
the NCP.
The Cold War time notion of extracting maximum benefit from rivalry
between major powers by smaller countries worked partially in the
case of Nepal. Former King Mahendra took advantage of the India–
China conflicts in the early 1960s. As the rapprochement between China
and the US took shape in 1972 and again between China and India
after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s official visit to Beijing in 1988, the
manoeuvrability capacity of Nepal reduced drastically. The direct
contacts and political level communications between India and China
did not give much space to the smaller neighbours of India, including
Nepal, to create misunderstanding on broader geo-strategic front.
Moreover, Nepal has hardly been a bridging point between China and
India in shaping their bilateral relations ever since the establishment of
diplomatic ties. India–China bilateral trade reached over $90 billion
without using trans-Himalayan connectivity networks. Nepal became
unsuccessful in its attempt to project itself as an unavoidable and
effective economic bridge between India and China despite several
attempts by its leaders.
The Himalayan region is going to witness intense competition between
the US, China, and India in the future. In this scenario, there are less
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 63
possibilities of any early solution to the border disputes between India
and China. Both the countries will try to focus more on improving
border infrastructure in the Himalayan region. From India’s point of
view, the Himalayas will continue to remain the first line defence barrier
against Chinese aggression in the northern front. At the same time,
India will also try to continue projecting itself as a dominant power by
signalling to both the US and China not to cross the redline(s) and
challenge its sphere of influence in the South Asian region.
At the same time, it will also be a litmus test for Kathmandu to show
that it can strike a balance between the country’s domestic aspirations
and its neighbours’ sensitivities. Neither China nor India can fully achieve
the development aspirations of Nepal on their own. While its southern
neighbour offers transit facilities and an easy market for Nepal’s trading
activity, its northern neighbour has ability to extend technological and
financial support. However, at any point in time, India will be in
advantageous position while dealing with its South Asian neighbours,
perhaps except Pakistan, in matters related to democracy, regional
economic developments, disaster management, and cultural issues. In
fact, India has been the first and the quickest responder during the
crisis situation (natural disasters) in South Asia due to its geo-cultural
proximity.

and diversification of its foreign policy. The tiny Himalayan landlocked
country, which had hardly played an important role in world politics
and which struggled to survive as an independent state till the 17th
century, has attracted global attention for its focus on GNH (Gross
National Happiness) and its campaign against climate change. It has
gradually emerged as a strategically important country in the
contemporary world. The geo-political shifts in Asia, emergence of
India and China as major powers in the world politics, border disputes
between the two most populated countries of the world, and separatist
movement in Tibet have helped Bhutan gain significance in Asian politics.
As a result, major world powers like the US, China, Australia, and
Japan are trying to establish direct diplomatic relations with Bhutan.
Bhutan further attracted attention of the international community when
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertook his first official
foreign trip to Thimphu in June 2014. From the Bhutanese point of
view, this was the first bilateral visit from a big country, which selected
Bhutan as its first foreign destination. The visit indicated the strategic
relevance of Bhutan to India and a diplomatic victory for Bhutan to
stand one step ahead of other South Asian countries. Articulating India’s
relationship with Bhutan, PM Modi said, “Bhutan and India share a

very special relationship that has stood the test of time.”106 Modi’s
‘B4B’ (Bharat for Bhutan) announcement with a B2B (Business to
Business) model reflects that India is equally dependent on its smaller
neighbours as far as security and unhindered search for renewable energy
and development are concerned. This is a stark departure from earlier
thinking in India’s neighbourhood policy that looked at smaller
neighbours as being more dependent on India and that the relation
was essentially a one-way traffic. Soon after, Modi’s visit to Nepal
further emphasised India’s neighbourhood priority and also signalled
the strategic significance of the Himalayan countries.
STRATEGIC RELEVANCE OF BHUTAN
Bhutan is strategically an important country for China, India and other
major powers of the world. However, its potential is not fully utilised
due to its limited interaction with major powers. From India’s point
of view, first, Bhutan is part of its northern security system. There is
also an open border and free movement of people between the two
countries. The overwhelming presence of any other foreign country in
Bhutan makes India vulnerable. Second, the western border of Bhutan
could offer an easy access route for Chinese troops to the Siliguri
corridor, also known as the chicken neck area of India. Chinese control
over this area would cut the North-East from the mainland. Third, the
strategically important Himalayan pass created by Manas river, eastern
Bhutan, is again important for both China and India. This pass does
not get snow during winter. This route was used by the Indian army to
retreat to Kameng district of Bhutan during the 1962 war.107 Four,
from the Chinese point of view, Bhutan is part of its extended periphery.
The unsafe extended periphery might affect internal security. Moreover,
this is the only neighbouring country which does not have any direct

diplomatic relations with China. Lack of information on Bhutan and
Indian military training to the Bhutanese army makes China curious to
have its presence in Thimphu. Five, there is a cultural linkage between
Bhutan and Tibet and more than 1,000 Tibetan refugees live in Bhutan.
The Chinese feel that given the easy access to Tibet from Bhutan, external
forces, including India, might create instability in Tibet. Lastly, from
the western countries’ point of view, like Nepal, Bhutan could be used
as a monitoring point about the internal situation in Tibet, conflict in
the North-East region of India and the border dispute between China
and India.
Most importantly, the Chinese railway connection near Bhutan’s north-
western border would have immense strategic and economic potential.
The railway might revive some of the traditional trade routes between
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Bhutan. That could prove to
be an alternative transit route for Bhutan in future. According to a
Bhutanese scholar, “The economic importance of the railroad—that
China has long announced it is building—from Gyantse to Phari (in
the sensitive Yadong county, where Chumbi valley is located) cannot
be underestimated.”108 Phari was a traditional border trading hub for
Bhutan and the TAR. The modern Bhutan’s trade with China (limited
to only Hong Kong as of January 2021) is mostly carried over sea
routes by using Indian and Bangladeshi sea ports. According to Bhutan
trade statistics, Bhutan’s import from China stood at Nu 611M in 2010.
There are reports about increase in number of Chinese tourists in
Bhutan. A total of 6,878 Chinese tourists visited Bhutan in 2018 and all
of them reportedly travelled by air.109 The purpose of Chinese railway
connectivity closer to Bhutan border could be to push for cross-border
bilateral trade and tourism in future.

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 67
POLICY OF LIMITED ENGAGEMENT (PLE)
Geographical location, territorial and population size, preservation of
national identity and sovereignty, limited economic resources, Buddhism
and underdevelopment have determined the foreign policy of Bhutan
since the 17th century. Until 1959, Bhutan in fact had adopted a policy
of limited engagement (PLE). The Chinese annexation of Tibet in
1959 was the eye opener for the Bhutanese leadership about its own
vulnerability given the then policy of territorial readjustment followed
by the People’s Republic of China and subsequently by the Republic
of India. Although it had signed the 1910 Treaty of Friendship with
British India, known as the Treaty of Punakha, and the Treaty of Peace
and Friendship with India in 1949, its foreign policy was confined
mostly towards Tibet. It had trade and cultural relations with Tibet.
Although PLE was adopted due to the then circumstances facing the
country and that later became successful in preserving its territorial
integrity, the same became gradually irrelevant with application of
modern communication technology and globalisation. The PLE of
Bhutan has been a tactic that small states often adopt to survive in the
international system due to resource and structural scarcity in terms of
limited economic and military capabilities to defend their territory. The
policy of isolationism has both security and preservation of “traditional
religio-cultural identity.”110 As a result, they are often dependent on
other powerful states.111 Therefore, Bhutan, gradually and carefully, while
taking India’s sensitivity into consideration, diversified its foreign relations
since 1962 when it became a member of the Colombo Plan.
DIVERSIFICATION OF FOREIGN POLICY: PHASE I
While Bhutan’s PLE was successful in achieving its goal initially, the
same gradually became obsolete with new international order in the

post-colonial period and again in the post-Cold War period. As a result,
like any other small state, Bhutan also devised new techniques to survive
as a sovereign and independent country. Meanwhile, Chinese annexation
of Tibet in 1959 made Bhutan feel insecure. Therefore, Bhutan’s strive
to join the UN in the late 1960s and also other international
organisations had a combination of security, political, and economic
imperatives. Had Bhutan joined the UN only to protect its sovereignty
and territorial integrity, as interpreted by some scholars, then it could
have withdrawn the 1949 Treaty with India. Prof. Muni observes that
Bhutan’s attempt for regional and international initiatives have been
“inspired by a combination of fears and aspirations.”112
Second, international recognition is an inherent right of any sovereign
country without which formation of a sovereign state is incomplete.
This has been a practice in the international system. “A sovereign,
independent state is a normal international person with the capacity to
enter into international relations with other States.”113 For example, when
Bangladesh was formed in 1971, it was recognised by India and Bhutan
immediately as a sovereign independent country.
Third, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, during his official
visit to Bhutan in 1958, suggested to the then king that Bhutan should
abandon its isolationist policy and take India’s support to improve its
economy. Although Bhutan took two years’ time to execute the
suggestion, it was a conscious decision of Bhutan and India that the
former must be economically and militarily strong to defend its territory.
Bhutan introduced its first five-year plan for rapid economic growth
in 1961. It was in this period that Bhutan introduced a new philosophy
called “Gross National Happiness”. Bhutan needed huge amount of
economic support to implement this philosophy, although it did not
evaluate the overall happiness in terms of material gains in totality.
Since economic and technological support from India was not sufficient
to fulfil its requirement, Bhutan perhaps thought of taking help from

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 69
other sources. Bhutan was extremely careful in selecting countries to
establish bilateral relations beyond India. Since it did not want to get
trapped in the Cold War rivalry and taking into account India’s sensitivity
over the presence of external forces on Bhutanese territory, Bhutan
decided to seek help of UN agencies. In case of bilateral relations, it
selected only small countries witnessing problems similar to Bhutan in
order to generate a common voice against possible aggressions from
big powers.114
Four, despite Bhutan having a treaty and receiving periodical assurance
from India for its territorial and independent status, it suspected India.
This was unfounded. Some scholars argue that this began after Sikkim
merged with India in 1974. Bhutan felt that the same fate might befall
on it. One Bhutanese scholar observed that “a very close and intimate
relationship with India does not mean that Bhutan took India into a
total trust.”115 Therefore, it diversified its foreign policy and joined
various international organisations in the 1970s.
Other scholars have argued that yet another factor for opting for
diversification was to protect the monarchy and neutralise India’s
influence in the internal matters of Bhutan. Bhutan was not comfortable
with India’s interference in the internal matters of Nepal and the way it
supported democratic forces from its soil. Bhutan thought that the
same might happen with it in future. However, the balance of power
in the Sub-Himalayan region tilted in favour of China after the defeat
of India in the 1962 war. India’s image before small countries as a
protector was in shambles.116
But the fact of the matter was that Bhutan was already a member of
seven international organisations that included: the Colombo Plan (1962),
the Universal Postal Union (1966) and UN (1971), the United Nations

Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD-1971), Group
of 77 (1971), the United Nations Economic & Social Commission
for Asia & the Pacific (ESCAP-1971), and the Non-Aligned Movement
(1973). The memberships had materialised despite Bhutan facing
restrictions in its foreign policy choices due to the then existing Bhutan–
India Friendship Treaty of 1949. Moreover, Bhutan did not face any
opposition while taking UN membership like Nepal faced in 1949
due to its 1950 Treaty with India. Rather, the international community
accommodated its membership as a sovereign, independent country.
Further, Bhutan had already established diplomatic relations with
Bangladesh in April 1973. As per the existing international norms, only
one sovereign and independent country needs to recognise a State as
sovereign and independent country and establish diplomatic relations.
If India had any territorial interest in Bhutan, it would not have
supported Bhutan’s joining these international organisations. Bhutanese
elites, perhaps, misinterpreted the scenario that India was obsessed
with security issues, especially for integrating the Himalayan countries
with its northern security system. Therefore, linking Bhutan’s
diversification with the Sikkim merger was unfounded. The
diversification was more of an economic imperative than insecurity
of Bhutan against India. Officially, no such grievance was brought up
during bilateral meetings or exchange of high level visits since the
establishment of diplomatic relations between both the countries.
Rather, Bhutanese suspicion towards China has some substance because
the latter on some occasions claimed suzerainty over Bhutan and
published maps claiming some territories of northern Bhutan after
Tibet’s occupation.117 That has never been the case from the Indian
side.
Therefore, India supported the UN membership of Bhutan because,
first, it was a right of a sovereign country to become part of the
international organisation. India always considered Bhutan as a sovereign
independent country with special relations with India. In 1971, the then
117 Karma Galay, n. 111, p. 98.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 71
India’s Deputy Minister for External Affairs Surender Pal Singh stated,
“Bhutan is a sovereign, independent state with special treaty relations
with India.”118 Second, UN was considered as an alternative source of
funding for Bhutan’s development programmes rather than the big
powers. This shared India’s burden on funding development
programmes in Bhutan. For example, by the mid-1980s, Indian aid to
Bhutan was reduced to 42 per cent.119 Also, there was a convergence
of interest between Bhutan and India to protect Bhutan from further
Chinese expansion towards the south of the Himalayas. Being a UN
member, any attack on Bhutan would have brought serious international
pressure on China, although there have been incidents of military attacks
on other UN member countries. Third, in the event of an India–Pakistan
war and formation of Bangladesh, India might have thought of
blocking free passage of Chinese troops crossing to the Indian side by
using the territory of a sovereign independent country with UN
membership. Lastly, India wanted support of some countries to
recognise Bangladesh immediately after its formation. Bhutan’s
membership in the UN made India’s task easy.120
Despite having a friendly and cooperative relationship, Bhutan was to
some extent perplexed with integration of Sikkim with India in 1974
and failure of India to convince China on behalf of Bhutan to discuss
matters regarding Chinese claim of some Bhutanese territories. Bhutan
felt that it would be difficult to negotiate directly with China on border
disputes. Therefore, it demanded to bring amendments in the 1949
Treaty. Reacting to India’s cold response over the proposal, on 30
January 1961 the king of Bhutan expressed that “Bhutan is a sovereign
and independent State. If Bhutan desires, she can have direct negotiations
with China.”121 The same was reiterated by the then acting Prime Minister

of Bhutan Lhendup S. Dorji on 9 August 1964. He said, “Bhutan is
contemplating having independent relations with foreign
countries…there is no bar to Bhutan’s participation in independent
foreign relations since it is a sovereign country.”122 This was also the
time when India was reluctant to allow Bhutan to expand its bilateral
relations with major powers, particularly in 1974.123 Although the two
countries resolved the issue amicably in 1972, Bhutan was uneasy with
the compromise.
During this period, Bhutan also closely monitored India’s role in
supporting democratic forces in Nepal. Later when Lhotshampas
demanded democracy in Bhutan and some media reports linked Nehru’s
support to the movement, Bhutan’s anxiety over its territorial integrity
and threat to its monarchy doubled. Some pro-China groups in Bhutan
took advantage of the situation. They demanded that Bhutan should
not be overdependent on India and emulate the foreign policy of
Nepal to maintain a strategic balance between India and China. Since
the 1949 Treaty was written in Dzongkha, some Bhutanese elites, in
fact, interpreted that Bhutan is not obliged to India’s advice as suggested
in clause 2 of the 1949 Treaty. Bhutan repeatedly expressed its desire
to revise this treaty until 1979. Thereafter, Bhutan interpreted the treaty
on its own and took initiatives in foreign policy without consulting
India.124 At a press conference in Bombay in September 1979, King
Jigme Singye Wangchuk stated that the Indo-Bhutanese treaty of 1949
needed to be updated in the interest of both countries so that nothing
was left to “open interpretation”.125 This interpretation culminated into

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 73
differences of views between Bhutan and India on certain issues in the
NAM conference in Havana in 1979 and at various other international
forums. For the first time, Bhutan demanded more transit and trade
concession from India as member of the LLDC. The two countries
also had differences over holding border dialogue with China. In
1984, India flexed its policy by allowing Bhutan to hold talks on border
disputes with China. One scholar observed that “significant
developments in Bhutan’s gradual assertion of autonomy in relations
with India began in the late 1970s. Its diplomatic mission in New Delhi
was renamed as the Royal Bhutan Embassy in 1978.”126 By June 2003,
Bhutan had diplomatic relations with 22 countries and was a member
of 54 international organisations.
There were also domestic factors behind the diversification of Bhutan’s
foreign policy. Like Nepal, Bhutan was also equally vulnerable to political
conflict due to intense rivalry between the ruling clans of the Wangchuks
and the Dorjis. This rivalry was so intense that Prime Minister Jigme
Dorji was assassinated in 1964 and there was an assassination bid on
the former King as well. This clan competition for holding important
positions in the Bhutanese policy vitiated further due to a strong pro-
China group lobbying against Bhutan’s close relationship with India.
“The sudden and drastic changes in the power balance in the Himalayas
in the immediate post-1962 war period inevitably led to a re-evaluation
of certain aspects of Bhutan’s foreign policy. For the first time, some
support was expressed among the Bhutanese elite circles for emulation
of the Nepali foreign-policy model based upon equal friendship with
India and China combined with a balance-of-power strategy.”127
Another dimension to the internal conflict was suspicion between
Drukpas and Lhotshampas (the latter also known as Nepalese).128
By the early 1980s, Bhutan had taken the initiative to establish
relationships with regional countries along with other small countries

of other regions. The objective was to send a message to the international
community that Bhutan is a sovereign independent country like others,
and not only dependent on India. Another factor could be to seek
regional support to join SAARC, which was just proposed by
Bangladesh then. In this regard, Bhutan had sent its then Trade and
Industry Secretary, Om Pradhan, to Nepal to discuss possibilities of
the prospect for Bhutanese export of surplus agricultural products to
that country. The visit was followed by Nepal’s Foreign Secretary’s trip
to Bhutan in 1980 and both the countries discussed about establishment
of diplomatic and trade relations. Bhutan also initiated similar discussion
with Bangladesh during King Jigme Singye Wangchuk’s visit to Dhaka
in February 1984.129
THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT
Bhutan’s experiment with democracy began in 1998 when King Jigme
Singye Wangchuk voluntarily surrendered many of his executive powers
and declared that Bhutan would become a constitutional monarchy.
He ordered legal experts to study the constitutions of the world’s major
democracies. The final version of the Constitution was mailed to every
home in the country. In 2001, the King handed over the powers of
day-to-day governance to the Council of Ministers. The King then
abdicated the throne in favour of his son Jigme Khesar Namgyel in
2006. Under the draft Constitution of 2007, the King would become
the head of the state, but Parliament would have the power to get him
to abdicate by a majority two-thirds vote followed by a referendum.
Bhutan held the first elections for the National Congress (NC–B), the
Upper House of Parliament, on 31 December 2007. The NC has 25
seats, five of which are nominated by the King. The elections were
held in 15 constituencies out of the 20 elected seats in the presence of
the international media and observers. The process was peaceful, with

around 40 per cent voter turnout. There was either no candidate or
only one candidate in five other constituencies, namely Haa, Gasa,
Thimphu, Lhuentse, and Trashiyangtse. Elections to these seats were
held on 29 January 2008 after new candidates showed their willingness
to contest these seats. However, the general low voter turnout and
non-availability of candidates reflects a fault line in the new Constitution.
Since the members of the NC–B do not belong to any political party,
people took less interest in the elections. It is observed that stringent
electoral laws and two-party system discouraged people’s participation
in the electoral process.130
However, the democratic experiment in Bhutan was strengthened
further with the successful conclusion of the National Assembly (NA),
the Lower House of Parliament, elections on 24 March 2008. The
elections witnessed high voter turnout (around 79.4 per cent of the
3,18,465 registered voters). There were 94 candidates in the election
fray. Of the 47 seats in Parliament, 44 went to the Druk Phuensum
Tshogpa (DPT). The party’s chief, Jigmi Thinley, was a former prime
minister who promoted the gross national happiness (GNH) policy.
The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) won three seats as the Opposition
Party under the new Constitution.131 According to the August 2007
Constitution, Bhutan became a democratic country after the elections
for the National Assembly. As per the two-party system, the DPT and
the PDP were positioned as ruling and opposition parties in the
Parliament, respectively. The poor performance of the PDP raised
questions over the role of opposition in the new political system. People
were sceptical over two-party system, in general, and the PDP’s role as
opposition in particular. Soon after the elections, Karma Ura, Director
of the Centre for Bhutan Studies, a government-financed organisation,

remarked, “Functioning of democracy requires a good opposition. I
don’t know what will happen now. It’s not an ideal situation.”132
Although the King initiated the democratic process, the power of the
monarchy remains virtually intact, since the abdication procedure in
the Constitution against the King is very complicated. Also, the two
political parties have close proximity to the palace: the PDP was headed
by Sangay Nidup, maternal uncle of the King; the DPT was headed by
Jigme Thinley, a matrimonial relative of the King.133 A third party, Bhutan
People’s United Party (BPUP), formed by Sigay Dorji, was disqualified
by the Election Commission on 27 November 2007, on the grounds
that it lacked the will, competence, experience, qualification and
appropriate support to contest elections. Political parties in exile were
also banned.134 Those political groups which were seen as not being
favourable to the palace were disqualified from the process, thereby
putting a question mark over the sanctity of this stage-managed
democratic transition.
ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN FOREIGN POLICY MAKING
Until the adoption of multi-party democracy in Bhutan, the monarchy
was the final authority on foreign policy matters. Earlier, the King
nominated a cabinet headed by a prime minister. Since 1953, debates
and discussions on foreign policy issues in the National Assembly added
value to Bhutan’s domestic discourse on foreign policy. For example,
in 1967–68, the NA put pressure on the monarch to discuss with India
for Nepal to become a member of the UN.
In the post-democratic period, the cabinet got, to some extent, a free
hand in formulating foreign policy according to people’s and party

mandate. But, the fact of the matter is that as per the 2008 Bhutanese
Constitution, the King has a major role in determining the external
affairs of the country. The King “may promote goodwill and good
relations with other countries by receiving state guests and undertaking
state visits to other countries.”135 He, however, would be advised by
the Lhengye Zhungtshog and the prime minister on international affairs
from time to time. The Parliament can debate on any issue related to
external affairs of Bhutan. The country’s foreign policy would be guided
more by domestic demands and would be people-centric. Since the
Lhengye Zhungtshog is to “protect and strengthen the sovereignty of
the Kingdom, provide good governance, and ensure peace, security,
well-being and happiness of the people”136 and is accountable to
Parliament and the King on these issues, it would have a major say in
the formulation of the foreign policy to achieve these goals given
Bhutan’s geo-economic situation. Apart from that, the ruling parties
have to formulate a balanced foreign policy taking into consideration
people’s interest, security interest and neighbours’ sensitivity. For example,
one of the factors that led to DPT’s failure in the 2013 elections could
be due to its poor foreign policy towards India during its five years’
rule. That resulted in a trade imbalance with India, poor GDP and
investment, and short supply of cooking gas. Since Bhutan has been
dependent on India, people thought that the DPT policy in handling
relations with India would increase their plight in future if they were
voted back to power for a second term.
BHUTAN–INDIA FRIENDSHIP TREATY 2007 AND ITS
FOREIGN POLICY
The second phase of foreign policy diversification began in 2007 with
changes in the 1949 Treaty. The treaty was updated on 2 March 2007
through mutual consent. According to the new treaty, the government
of Bhutan would be no more obliged to consult and seek advice of
India on its external affairs issues. It would be free to have diplomatic

relations at both bilateral and multilateral levels. Both the countries
agreed to “cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their
national interests. Neither Government shall allow the use of its territory
for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other”
(Appendix 2). This was a major departure from the 1949 friendship
treaty under which the Bhutan government agreed to be “guided by
the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations”
(Appendix 3). This change has encouraged Bhutan to diversify its foreign
policy according to its national interest. The democratically elected
government took advantage of this and used the foreign policy to
fulfil the domestic demands.
DIVERSIFICATION OF FOREIGN POLICY–PHASE II
Thinley Period (2008–2013)
Bhutan witnessed the most diversified foreign policy during Jigmi Y.
Thinley led government from 2008 to 2013. It had diplomatic relations
with 22 countries when Thinley started to lead the first democratically
elected government. Within five years’ time, the country established
diplomatic relations with 31 countries. As a result, Bhutan had diplomatic
relations with 53 countries by the end of Thinley government’s rule.
As discussed, in the first phase, Bhutan’s foreign policy objective has
been to secure its territory with its distinctive culture and identity. Geo-
political changes in South Asia in general and Himalayan region in
particular, made Bhutan insecure. The anxiety was managed by
diversifying its foreign policy and expanding diplomatic relations. Leo
Rose has observed that “the basic principle of Bhutan’s foreign policy
in the 1970s [was] to gain international recognition of its status as a
sovereign component of the comity of nations without, however, at
the same time becoming entangled in international politics—beyond
South Asia.”137 The question arises: Was the same anxiety factored into
undertaking the second phase of diversification which resulted in

establishing diplomatic relations with 55 countries during the initial
democracy period?
DPT Election Manifesto
The Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) began its election campaigning
by promising GNH through “growth with equity and justice”. The
DPT 2008 election manifesto promised sustainable technology-based
economic growth (industrialisation, infrastructure building and
investment in agriculture) and clean environment to promote holistic
human development and happiness. Therefore, the party gave priority
to furthering economic liberalisation to attract more FDI and sharing
of state burden by encouraging the private sector to support rapid
economic growth in Bhutan. In this regard, the party utilised diplomatic
channels like attempting for WTO membership and taking advantage
of SAARC and BIMSTEC facilities without compromising with the
GNH. Interestingly, for the first time in the diplomatic history of Bhutan,
the party openly declared taking advantage of Chinese economic
growth to make Bhutan an excellent centre for international banking
and financial services. The party further promised that the country’s
foreign policy would be based on GNH and it would promote that at
the international level. In this regard, the party emphasised promoting
the image and profile of Bhutan and advancing goodwill and friendship
with other countries.138
After five years in government, the DPT again offered to diversify the
foreign policy further. The party felt proud after expanding Bhutan’s
bilateral relations with 53 countries. This effort strengthened Bhutan’s
sovereignty and security. According to its 2013–18 elections manifesto,
the party promised to take Bhutan towards self-reliance in the next
five years. In this regard, it promised to continue its economic policy
with private sector as the driving force of growth, which had started

Y. Thinley was President of the DPT during the 2008 elections. He became

Assembly elections.

from 2008 to 2013. Emphasis would be given to drive Bhutan from a
dependent economy to a self-reliant economy. The party claimed that
it brought Bhutan from an era of “isolation to a globalised world”.
The party believes that “multilateralism is the key to finding solutions
to the growing number of problems challenging the world”. The DPT
emphasised multilateralism rather than bilateralism, both at the global
and regional levels. The DPT foreign policy would focus more on
issues like sustainable development and campaign to popularise GNH
at the global level. Economic diplomacy would be a major focus.
Diplomacy would be used to generate resources both at multilateral
and bilateral levels to support Bhutan’s goal of self-reliance by 2020.
If possible, new donors would be arranged for the 11th five-year
plan.139
As reflected in the manifestos and foreign policy line adopted during
the Thinley government, the DPT foreign policy was focused more
on seeking global support for Bhutan for its economic growth,
strengthening its sovereignty and security in the last five years. The DPT
utilised regional and bilateral engagements of economic support and
the engagement at the global multilateral level for strengthening
sovereignty and security. Although the Thinley government
acknowledged India as a major contributor to Bhutan’s development
and the relationship has been very successful, it did not stop its search
for new donors and global partners, including China. The economic
issues dominated while establishing diplomatic relations with new
countries. Overall, the foreign policy was oriented towards maintaining
a balance between the global and regional level.
Both bilateral and multilateral relations/engagements were revived under
the democratically elected government. These relations were mostly
used for looking for alternative resources to cater to the economic
growth of Bhutan. This took care of Bhutan’s security, identity, and
economic issues. PM Thinley articulated, “When we [Bhutan] make
contacts and interact with more and more countries it strengthens our
139 Manifesto, Second Parliamentary Elections, 2013–2018, DPT, Bhutan.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 81
[Bhutan’s] image, it raises our profile and it enhances and secures our
sovereignty.”140 Moreover, Bhutan’s growth till 2008 was stagnant due
to excessive dependence on Indian investment. Thinley wanted rapid
development with Chinese technology and reduced dependence on
India. It was also difficult to ignore the rise of China. Considering that
China emerged as a major global power, Thinley wanted to maintain a
balance between India and China, in the same way the country tried in
the 1970s.
GNH was one of the major guiding principles of Thinley’s foreign
policy. To achieve GNH, the government diversified its foreign policy
in search of funds and resources. After being voted to power, as
promised, the DPT brought out its FDI policy in 2010. Earlier, Bhutan
had tried a similar policy. But that was confined to some countries and
the UN by taking into consideration India’s security concerns and also
to avoid getting entangled in the super powers’ race. He used GNH as
cultural diplomacy of Bhutan at the international level, especially at the
UN. Bhutan’s Prime Minister made it clear: “We are looking for
economic assistance from countries other than traditional donor nations,
but we are determined to ensure that such aid has no political strings
attached. We shall not seek aid from either the US or the USSR as we
do not wish to get involved in the super power racket.”141
Looking Beyond India
Bhutan–India relations have been one of the successful bilateral relations
in the sub-continent. Ever since the 1949 Treaty was signed and formal
diplomatic relations established in 1968, the relationship has been
trouble-free. Political leaders of both the countries from time to time
have acknowledged the relationship as “traditionally unique bilateral
relations, characterised by trust and understanding have matured over

the years.”142 India has been the largest trade and development partner
of Bhutan since 1961. Despite this, Bhutan was to some extent not
satisfied with the delay in completion of the infrastructure and
hydropower projects and disbursement of funds committed to the
five-year plans. Further, Bhutan wanted more development funds and
technological support for rapid economic growth under a
democratically elected government since 2008 so as to fulfil the
commitments made in the election manifesto like rapid economic
growth, infrastructure development, etc. It was difficult for India to
fulfil Bhutan’s requirements. Therefore, the Thinley government used
diplomacy to search for more resources with the aspiration of integrating
Bhutan’s economy with the global market.
One of the major foreign policy achievements of the Thinley
government was the proposals for establishing formal diplomatic
relations with China and the US. Although Beijing did not have direct
diplomatic relations with Thimphu, the Thinley government used the
already existing Bhutan–China border talk arrangements. First, a round
of border talks (19th round) was held under the democratically elected
government in January 2010 in Thimphu. The 20th round of border
talks were also held in Thimphu. On both the occasions, the Chinese
delegation met Bhutan’s prime minister and the monarch on the sidelines.
During the meetings, the Chinese delegation reiterated Beijing’s proposal
for establishing diplomatic and trade relations with Bhutan. In 2010,
the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying, who led the Chinese
delegation to Thimphu for border talks, had explicitly expressed China’s
desire to “build bridges of friendship and cooperation” with Bhutan.
The proposal generated public support in favour of China and some
sections in Bhutan argued that it should take advantage of this. People
in Bhutan thought that India should not oppose a formal relationship
between Bhutan and China as India’s own relations with China had
improved substantially. China reportedly also made a similar proposal
in 1998 during the 12th round of border talks. The Thinley government
perhaps thought of utilising that opportunity to establish relations with
China and seek public support in the forthcoming National Assembly
elections.

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 83
Taking advantage of the domestic atmosphere, for the first time, since
the Chinese occupied Tibet in 1959, the prime ministers of both the
countries met on the sidelines of the Rio Summit in June 2012. It is
believed that the meeting was initiated by China. There are conflicting
reports about issues discussed in the meeting. Bhutan’s official press
release stated: “They discussed bilateral issues of mutual interest and
multilateral cooperation including Bhutan’s bid for a non-permanent
seat in UN Security Council for the term 2013–2014.”143 On the
contrary, the official press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the People’s Republic of China said, “He [Prime Minister Thinley]
confirmed that Bhutan wishes to forge formal diplomatic ties with
China as soon as possible. Bhutan is willing to settle border issues with
China in a cooperative manner, enhance bilateral economic and trade
cooperation and people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and carry
out close communication and coordination in international and regional
affairs.”144
However, the fact of the matter was that there was a mutual interest to
improve the relationship and take it to higher levels. Most importantly,
Bhutan thought that China, being a permanent member of the UNSC
and an influential power, might use its clout at the international level to
support Bhutan’s candidature to a non-permanent seat in the UNSC.
Further, Bhutan does not have any direct diplomatic relations with the
P-5 of the UNSC. Just like Nepal thought, in the early 1950s, that
having diplomatic relations with the P-5 would ensure double security
to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Bhutan too might have thought
on similar lines. Some also suspect that it could be a tactic of pro-
Chinese groups in Bhutan to use the UNSC issue to allow China to
open its mission in Thimphu.
There could also be a business dimension to Thinley’s approach towards
China. As proposed in the DPT election manifesto that private sector

would play a significant role in economic development, during the
Thinley regime Bhutanese business houses wanted to have more
economic engagement with China. In fact, some say that China used
the aspirations of the newly emerging business class in Bhutan to
influence Bhutan’s foreign policy in its favour.145 For example, in July
2012, the Thinley government approved Global Traders and Gangjung
(GT) to supply Chinese made buses to Bhutan. Media sources said,
“The company’s owner is the Bhutanese Prime Minister’s son-in-law.”146
There is also convergence of interest about deepening trade relations.
Hong Kong is the second major trading partner of Bhutan after India.
Bhutan had exported software to Hong Kong worth $73 million with
a partner share of 16.18 per cent in 2011.147 In 2014, Hong Kong was
the second key export destination with 10.8 per cent of the total trade
and India was the top destination with 83.8 per cent export.148 According
to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade,
Bhutan’s export to Hong Kong was $1.48 million during 2012.149 Hong
Kong’s import from Bhutan was at $36.7 thousand during 2019.150
The intensity of trade relationship was even more evident when some
influential business houses of Bhutan wanted to cancel the government’s
decision of importing copper and issuing of “certificates of origin”

for export of software to Hong Kong. Bhutan’s government had
imposed restrictions on import and export of copper to check liquidity
of Indian Rupees due to the 2008 economic crisis. Therefore, under
pressure from the corporates, the Thinley government was exploring
to establish direct trade relations with China. From the Chinese point
of view, restoring trans-Himalayan trade could be a strategic gain in
the South Himalayas. This would enable China to access the Bhutanese
market and common people without having any direct diplomatic
presence in Thimphu.151

FOREIGN POLICY UNDER TSHERING TOBGAY
PDP Election Manifesto
Quite contrary to the DPT, the PDP foreign policy focused on “from
global level to sub-regional level”. The PDP manifesto said, “Foreign
policy will prioritise to strengthen our time-tested friendship with India.
We will foster good relations with the neighbouring Indian states of
West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim and Bihar to ensure
the safety of Bhutanese travelling through those states and to convenience
business relations.”152 In the first two years of the PDP government,
Bhutan’s foreign policy focused on strengthening relations with India,
Bangladesh, and Nepal and supporting SAARC, BIMSTEC and sub-
regionalism to improve Bhutan’s economy. Bhutan also strengthened
its relationship with other countries. It had been cautious though and
prioritised Bhutan’s security and sovereignty. Further, while the DPT
emphasised more on economic issues, the PDP focused on security
and sovereignty issues. Interestingly, while the DPT tried to glorify the
GNH during its regime and promised to do that further in its 2013
manifesto, the PDP believed that no party should take ownership of
the GNH. In this regard, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay said, “I
believe it’s not the job of the government to do that (exporting GNH).
What we know of it we’ll seek to aggressively implement (for domestic
purposes only).”153 He feels that the GNH has failed to fulfil people’s
expectations since it became the “basis for Bhutan’s foreign policy”.154

Bilateral Visits Undertaken by Tshering Tobgay (2013–

1. 12 April 2015: Tshering Tobgay undertook an official visit to Sri
Lanka.
2. 10–18 January 2015: Undertook official visit to India and attended

5. 29 June–3 July 2014: Tshering Tobgay visited Japan.
6. August 2013: Undertook an official visit to India.
A comparison of major foreign visits during Thinley and Tobgay
periods reflected that Thinley’s foreign policy was more inclined
towards the UN, multilateral organisations and major powers. Other
than India, he undertook more visits to non-South Asian countries or
regions. During these visits, he mostly discussed GNH and climate
change issues. He also requested major powers, including China, to
invest in infrastructure development of Bhutan. While Thinley’s foreign
policy was more outward, Tobgay’s was inward-looking.
On the contrary, Tobgay paid more visits to South Asian and East
Asian countries. Interestingly, no major diplomatic relations were
established during Prime Minister Tobgay’s government till June 2015.
The PDP manifesto did not elaborate on the foreign policy of Bhutan.
When PM Tobgay was questioned, he replied that his government
would continue “to follow the foreign policies put in place by our
wise monarchs. It has served us exceedingly well over the last half-
century and we believe it will continue to do so for the foreseeable
future.”155 This indicated that PDP reversed the foreign policy adopted

during the Thinley period. His foreign policy focused more on building
partnership with South Asian countries, especially with India. During
this period, Bhutan wanted to set an example by taking a lead role in
regional cooperation and integration. Although both the regimes
acknowledged India’s contribution towards the economic well-being
of Bhutan and as a benign all-weather friend, Thinley went one step
ahead by seeking help of China and multilateral organisations for
technological and economic support. Tobgay expressed more faith on
India’s timely economic support than his predecessor. During Prime
Minister Modi’s visit to Thimphu in June 2014, Prime Minister Tobgay
said, “India is the cornerstone of Bhutan’s foreign policy. The Bhutan
Government is committed to this policy.”156 In an interview to one
Indian private news channel, he in fact categorically said, “There is no
question of a Chinese embassy in Bhutan”.157
However, the Tobgay government continued with the previous
government’s policy for attracting more FDI in infrastructure
development. Immediately after assuming power, the PDP invited
private foreign investments in small hydro projects. In January 2015,
the government further relaxed the FDI policy to attract investors.
While around 33 FDI projects worth Nu 24.77B (billion) were
approved from 2010 to 2014, around 18 new projects were approved
in principle as of January 2015.158

FOREIGN POLICY OF DR LOTAY TSHERING GOVERNMENT
While the future of Bhutan’s foreign policy was rigorously debated
during the 2008 and 2013 elections, the same was missing in the 2018
elections. No political parties elaborately discussed the future foreign
policy of Bhutan. While the PDP manifesto talked about strengthening
Bhutan’s relations with the wider world through active participation in
global, regional and multilateral organisations like EU, SAARC, and
BIMSTEC,159 there was no mention of foreign policy issues in the
manifesto of the DPT and Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa (DNT), which
won the 2018 elections. Interestingly, the DNT in fact appealed for
vote by branding the PDP and the DNT as pro-India and pro-China
parties respectively.
Despite being critical of PDP over its foreign policy, a micro analysis
of Lotay Tshering’s foreign policy since 2018 reflects that it has almost
replicated PDP’s foreign policy with minor modifications. Since the
DNT was a new political party and it did not have much experience
on Bhutan’s foreign policy, there was speculation in the Indian media
that the DNT government could follow a Nepal-like rebalancing policy
between India and China as Lotay Tshering gave lot of emphasis on
resuming border dialogue with China, during the election campaign.
In the post-democratic period, there is a growing and open voice in
favour of having direct diplomatic relations with China. Surprisingly,
in the post election period, PM Lotay Tshering, in an interview to The
Telegraph, stated, “Our [DNT] views are very clear on foreign policy
and we believe that it cannot change every five years. Our King (Jigme
Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck) will be the guiding force on matters of
foreign policy… And on India, we believe that Bhutan-India relationship
is non-negotiable.”160

After assuming office, PM Dr Tshering undertook first overseas bilateral
visit to India during 27–29 December 2018, which was also the year
when the two countries celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations.
PM Modi was the first world leader who congratulated Dr Tshering
over DNT’s electoral success and Bhutan’s interim government over
successful completion of the third parliamentary elections in October
2018. PM Modi reciprocated the visit by undertaking a two-day state
visit to Thimphu in August 2019. This was his first official visit to
Bhutan after assuming office second time and second visit to Bhutan
in the last five years. Earlier, as part of neighbourhood first policy,
Prime Minister Modi chose Bhutan as his first visit abroad after assuming
office in May 2014.
India as priority country for Bhutan was apparent when Foreign Minister
Dr Lyonpo Tandi Dorji undertook a week-long visit to India in
November 2019, when the DNT government completed one year in
office on 7 November 2019. During the visit, Dr Dorji held bilateral
discussions with his Indian counterpart External Affairs Minister Dr S.
Jaishankar and reviewed the entire gamut of Indo-Bhutan relations.
Besides India, Bhutan gave high priority to Bangladesh. PM Dr Tshering
paid a state visit to Bangladesh during 12–15 April 2019 coinciding
with the celebration of Bangla New Year, Pokhela Boisakh. The visit
strengthened the bilateral relationship between both the countries
further. After India, Bangladesh is a major bilateral partner and a transit-
trade country for Bhutan. Bangladesh, on 7 December 2020, signed its
maiden preferential trade agreement (PTA) with Bhutan to boost
bilateral trade between the two countries. Some 100 Bangladeshi
products will get duty-free access to Bhutan. In return, 34 Bhutanese
products will get duty-free access to the Bangladeshi market.
Moreover, continuing with the tradition of diversifying foreign policy,
Bhutan established formal diplomatic relations with the State of Israel
on 12 December 2020. Like the previous governments, Prime Minister
Dr Lotay Tshering on 5 August 2019, directed to prioritise economic
diversification. He emphasised on two major aspects of the economic
diversity. First, Bhutan should shift its import-driven economy to
investment-driven economy. Secondly, Bhutan could diversify its revenue
generating sectors from hydro projects. The larger objective of these
steps being to attract FDI and technology for rapid economic growth,

and prepare Bhutan for post-LDC graduation period. The PM also
indicated about reducing stress on hydro projects perhaps considering
the environmental aspects.161
Is Bhutan on the US Radar?
Bhutan has limited diplomatic relations with the US. After changes in
the 1949 Treaty in February 2007 and adoption of democracy, via
constitutional monarchy, in 2008, major powers like the US and China
have been trying to establish diplomatic relations with Thimphu. Then
US ambassador to Delhi, David C. Mulford, visited Thimphu after
two months of revision of treaty with India to explore the possibilities
of having direct diplomatic relations with Bhutan. As part of its new
policy towards Thimphu, the US rehabilitated around 80,000 Bhutanese
refugees. Most importantly, US state department and defence
department had invited Bhutan’s military officials for military training
centres in the US. USAID-supported trainings on a range of disaster
management topics for Bhutanese officials were also held. The US
also provided support to Bhutan to fight COVID-19 and its economic
impact. Bhutan also received State Department-supported assistance
to implement programmes to counter trafficking in persons and to
support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)
programming. Bhutanese officials and military officers have attended
courses at the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies.162
The US policy towards Bhutan has been to work with India rather
than supplant the traditional alliance between the two countries.163 As a
mark of the beginning of the diplomatic relations with Bhutan, US

Senator John McCain’s delegation arrived at Thimphu after the US
Presidential elections in 2008. This visit was followed by the visit of
US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs,
Robert O. Blake Jr., in April 2010. Blake headed a delegation to the
SAARC Summit in Thimphu on 28–29 April 2010. He met Bhutanese
leaders on the margins of the Summit and discussed about the
conditions of the refugees and other bilateral issues.164 This was the
first ever visit by a senior US official to Thimphu. Under Secretary of
State for Democracy and Global Affairs, María Otero, then visited
Bhutan in February 2011.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and Bhutan’s Prime Minister Tshering
Tobgay had a meeting on the sidelines of the 7th Vibrant Gujarat
Summit in Ahmedabad in January 2015. After the meeting, a senior
US official said US has been keen to strengthen ties with Bhutan but
there is no plan to establish diplomatic relationship with the Himalayan
nation.165
Despite these high-profile visits and initiatives by the US to improve
relations with Bhutan, the US–Bhutan relations never reached a
comfortable position. Western countries view that in the post-
democratic period, Bhutan has come out of India’s shadow. The
repatriation of Nepalese refugees has been a major obstacle in
improving the relationship between the two countries. Bhutan perhaps
does not want further discussion with the US on this issue. It suspects
US role in rehabilitating over 80,000 Bhutanese refugees, who could
create problems in future.

BHUTAN AND MULTILATERALISM
United Nations
Bhutan became a member of the UN in September 1971. Given its
size, geo-political location and special relations with India under the
then 1949 Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the UN membership
reaffirmed its identity and status as a sovereign nation before the
international community. The UN membership benefitted Bhutan both
politically and economically. Politically, Bhutan, as a small country, got a
platform to raise its concerns and participated in the debates of global
issues affecting it directly and indirectly. Economically, Bhutan benefitted
through UN specialised agencies, both in terms of financial and
technical assistance. The UN agencies played a significant role in social
transformation, skill and economic development since 1973. Since
Bhutan has had limited diplomatic missions, its permanent missions in
New York and Geneva worked as windows to reach the world
community and coordinate with other countries for political, cultural,
and economic programmes.166
India played an important role in Bhutan’s UN membership bid. India
was the first country to support Bhutan in the UN. Unfortunately,
some scholars, who have supported China’s role in South Asia and in
Bhutan and Nepal in particular, argue that Bhutan joined the UN because
it was concerned about India’s plan of merging Sikkim. It felt that
there could be similar action against Bhutan despite having a standing
Treaty with India. The anxiety of losing sovereignty prompted the
then Bhutanese King Jigme Dorji to use the China card secretly to
build pressure on India for seeking Bhutan’s UN membership. As a
former Foreign Minister of Nepal observed: “King Jigme Dorji
initiated contact with China to help pressurise India…This was clearly
a pressure tactics to prove support to Bhutan King to convince India

the need for Bhutan joining the UN.”167 However, the fact of the
matter is that Bhutan was already a member of the UN when Sikkim
was merged with India in 1974. By that time, Bhutan had also joined
NAM and had diplomatic relations with Bangladesh.
Rather, it was in the interest of India to protect the Himalayan countries
from Chinese aggression so that their territories could not be used to
attack India, thereby protecting its own interest in future. India thus
helped them to join the UN. India perhaps also wanted a strong regional
support to recognise Bangladesh after its formation in 1971. Bhutan
was the second country which recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign
country, after India. Bhutan also benefitted by having a newly
independent country as its neighbour with alternative transit facilities.
Bhutan has been consistently contributing to UN programmes. It has
become a member of around 20 UN specialised and related
organisations over a period of time. It has held important positions in
the UN such as the Vice President of the UN General Assembly,
President of the Trade and Development Board, UN Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), two terms as member of the
UN Commission on Human Rights, two terms as member of the
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC, 1993–95), Executive Board
of UNICEF and WHO, and Chairman of the Third Committee during
the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of the UN in 1995.168
Despite its commitment to international norms and “respect for
international law and treaty obligations”, Bhutan is not a signatory of
the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees relating to the Status of Refugees
or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Around 1,298
Tibetan refugees have been living in seven settlements in Bhutan. In the
absence of an asylum and refugee granting policy and strict provisions

to get citizenship, these refugees have been living perpetually as stateless

In the post-democracy period, the Prime Minister of Bhutan represented
the people and forcefully affirmed Bhutan’s aspirations to seek a non-
permanent membership at the Security Council. Addressing the 67th
United Nations General Assembly on 28 September 2012, Prime
Minister Jigmi Y. Thinley highlighted the serious implications of climate
change in general and to the mountain ecosystem in particular. He
demanded equality of opportunity in the UN system. He pointed out
that “all states, regardless of size, population, level of development,
must be permitted the opportunity to contribute by bringing diversity
of thought, approach and indeed, their will, to the work of the
Council”.170 During this period, Bhutan generated a new debate by
writing to the UN members about GNH.171 Although the GNH
formula was rejected by the UNGA, Bhutan kept on arguing that
“development must be guided by a clear home-grown vision that
placed people’s welfare and happiness as its central objective”.172

171 Originally developed in 1972 by then King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye
Wangchuck, there were four indicators of GNH. Those were: good
governance, sustainable socio-economic development, cultural preservation,
and environmental conservation. By 1974, it was further improved into nine
dimensions: psychological well-being, health, education, time use, cultural
diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological
diversity and resilience, and living standards. Source: http://

Thinley visited UNGA in September 2011 and 2012. He talked about
GNH in 2011. He countered the concept of GDP by justifying the
concept of GNH. In 2011, the General Assembly adopted a “happiness
resolution”, noting that GDP “does not adequately reflect the happiness
and well-being of people in a country” and empowering Bhutan to
speak to member states about the need for happiness to be a key
component of their economies. It countered the western definition
and justified traditional concept of happiness. Bhutan created a new
identity and remained in the limelight because of the GNH issue. In
2012, he focused on climate change and non-permanent membership
of the Security Council. Thinley demanded that Bhutan be nominated
as a non-permanent member of SC for the year 2013–14.
It is assumed that the King was dissatisfied with the Thinley government’s
aggressive international public relations campaign to promote GNH
at the expense of domestic needs. The GNH was propagated by
Bhutan’s fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972, which later
became the Buddhist nation’s unique way of measuring national
progress in terms of the well-being and happiness of its people instead
of using GDP as the indicator. The objective of such a concept could
have been to popularise monarchy and establish that monarchy had
been benevolent to its subjects. The Thinley government’s initiative
brought a bad name to the monarchy both at the domestic and
international levels as UN passed resolutions against the concept. What
could be the reason for the Thinley government to discuss GNH at
the UN and organising a special conference in 2012? Was he anti-
monarchy? How did his Harvard education help in shaping a new
foreign policy for Bhutan?
The second democratically elected government led by Tobgay reverted
to the foreign policy of Nepal and stated that the king should lead
efforts to popularise GNH around the world and not the elected head
of the government.173

NAM
Bhutan joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1973. The
Permanent Mission of Bhutan in New York manages the regular
Coordinating Bureau Meetings of NAM, which has added another
feather to its sovereignty status. Bhutan actively highlighted the plight
of small states and supported an agenda related to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of small states. It supported the NAM principles on
imperialism and colonialism. Bhutan asserted its independent stance at
the NAM summit conference in Havana, Cuba, in 1979, by voting
along with China and some South East Asian countries (instead of
with India) on the issue of allowing Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge to
participate in the conference.174
In the 16th NAM summit in Tehran in 2012, Bhutan lobbied extensively
with NAM members and observers for its non-permanent membership
of UNSC.175 The Bhutanese delegation was led by PM Thinley. It seems
that Bhutan seized the Tehran summit as an opportunity to create some
space in global politics by articulating its viewpoint confidently for the
first time in the NAM summit. As a major diplomatic victory for the
first time, Bhutan was elected as one of the vice chairs of the 16th
summit of the NAM. Bhutan used the NAM platform to highlight
and generate support of the global community on protection of small
states against the adverse impact of climate change and food shortages.
Bhutan also shared its experience of having “pursued GNH for over

four decades by balancing material growth with mental and spiritual
enrichment within a stable environment”.176
Bhutan took a slightly different position at the 18th NAM Summit in
Baku, Azerbaijan. Bhutan’s foreign secretary Sonam Tshong reiterated
his country’s strong commitment to the movement’s principles of self-
determination, respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-
aggression, and non-interference in internal affairs. Bhutan highlighted
the relevance and importance of NAM, especially to smaller member
states, and also called for greater financial and technical support to the
least developed countries and middle income countries, to ensure that
the climate change transition is sustainable. Since the Baku Summit
happened after the Doklam incident, Bhutan contemplated discussing
about security challenges to the small states. Unlike previous summits,
Bhutan did not discuss about GNH at this summit. 177
LLDC
Bhutan is listed in the LLDC by the UNCTAD. According to the
Committee for Development Policy (CDP) of the UN, Bhutan would
graduate from LDC in 2023. However, the COVID-19 pandemic
might force Bhutan to request UN agencies to hold the process since it
might lose financial support from the UN and its agencies. It might
also lose 26 per cent of the Official Development Assistance (ODA)
revenues and loss of trade concessions.178 Addressing the 75th UN

Minister Dr Lotay Tshering requested the UN to reset the LDC

graduation path to help the country regain its grip on a smooth transition
from the LDC category. “It would be extremely challenging especially
for developing countries to reverse their economies. Now everything
is changed. Our focus has shifted to saving lives and livelihoods from
the challenges posed by the pandemic”, he said.
Interestingly, like Nepal, Bhutan is less active in LLDC debate over
more transit facilities to these countries. It could be due to its friendly
relations with India and multiple transit facilities offered by India to
Bhutan in comparison to two transit ports to Nepal for third country
exports. Another factor could be Bhutan’s limited trans-oceanic trade
than other LLDCs. Most of its exports take place to/via India and
Bangladesh. That way Bhutan saves foreign currency on transportation
and insurance. Moreover, Bhutan’s transit trade with India is handled
by its own customs agency.179 In case any problems arise on the transit
trade issue, both the countries prefer to resolve them at the bilateral
level rather than discussing at international forums and politicising the
issues unnecessarily. Lastly, Bhutan also avails duty-free transit of its
goods for trade with third countries.180 However, Bhutan played an
important role along with Zambia, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso
for the establishment of the LDC fund within the Kyoto Protocol
and drew attention of the international community on the fragile
mountain ecosystems in the sixth session of the Conference of Parties
(COP), Part II to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Bonn in July 2001.181

Campaign against climate change impacts and sustainable development
has been a major agenda of Bhutan’s foreign policy. It has garnered a
fair amount of international recognition for that. Bhutan as a chair of
the LDC groups at the UNFCCC, on 9 December 2020 hosted the
Thimphu Ambition Summit: Momentum for a 1.5°C World, to
encourage global climate action. The objective of Thimphu Ambition
Summit was to convene and discuss critical issues around ambition,
climate finance, and the green economic recovery.
SAARC
Like other small neighbours of India, Bhutan also supported the
formation of SAARC. It was one of the founding members of the
SAARC. When the concept of regional cooperation was proposed by
Bangladesh, the then Bhutan King immediately supported the idea and
wanted to join the group for his country’s recognition as an independent
country at the regional level. In one of the SAARC foreign ministers’
meeting in Thimphu in 1985, the King pointed out that “the region
needed harmonious cooperation among its members”. He urged the
seven nations to “forget their past differences and look into shaping
the future on the basis of mutual trust and confidence in each other”.182
The South Asian region witnessed major territorial rearrangement in
the 1970s like formation of Bangladesh in 1971, merger of Sikkim
with India in 1974, Nepal’s proposal of “Zone of Peace”, frequent
Chinese incursion into Bhutan’s territory, etc. Given this geo-political
turmoil, Bhutan was nervous over securing its territorial integrity. The
then Bhutan King also demanded revision of the 1949 Treaty with
India. There was a rumour that Bhutan could be the next target of
India after Sikkim. As a result, Bhutan perceived India as a threat to its
sovereignty, and in fact, took a different position in the NAM summit
in Havana in 1979, perhaps to reaffirm its sovereignty and independence
in foreign policy.183

POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 101
Bhutan and other smaller countries of South Asia felt that SAARC
would benefit them more, rather than dealing with India bilaterally.
They also felt that the arrangement would improve their bargaining
power with India. One scholar observed that for Bhutan, “the
association would be a mechanism through which it could expand its
foreign relations with other countries without antagonising India and
also expand its economic interaction with others to reduce the
dependence on India.”184 India’s reluctance to the SAARC proposal
doubled the suspicion of its smaller neighbours, including Bhutan. The
guarantee to “sovereign equality, territorial integrity, national
independence, non-use of force and non-interference in internal affairs
of other states and peaceful settlement of all disputes” in the SAARC
Charter gave much solace to Bhutan. Former foreign secretary of India,
Muchkund Dubey, observed, “The apprehension of loss of identity
and the fear of threat to their sovereignty emanating from the bigger
neighbour, is often so great that the smaller neighbours do not want to
come closer to India even if it is clearly in their interest to do so.”185
Later, Bhutan used the SAARC platform to put pressure on India on
trade and transit route through Indian territory to use Bangladesh’s sea
ports with the support of other smaller member countries.186 During
this period, India’s relationship with Bhutan also improved due to family
friendship between Rajiv Gandhi and the then Prince of Bhutan. This
was the period when the King represented Bhutan in the SAARC
meetings (this continued till 2008).
As a founding member, Bhutan has been offered full cooperation in
the regional development issues. Therefore, Bhutan’s contribution to
SAARC is much higher in comparison to other international

organisations. Since Bhutan is considered as the most non-controversial
member with good relations with other member countries, two
important SAARC offices are also located in Bhutan SAARC
Development Fund and SAARC Forestry Centre (SFC). Bhutan also
organised several conferences and seminars on forestry, environment,
agriculture, rural development, food crisis in the Himalayan region,
etc. It facilitated a meeting between the LTTE and Sri Lankan
government to resolve the ethnic conflict in the Island in July 1985.
The purpose of this meeting was that Bhutan wanted to reduce the
misunderstanding between India and Sri Lanka over the Tamil issue,
which delayed the formation of SAARC.
Bhutan hosted the 16th SAARC Summit in April 2010 for the first time
in the 25 years of formation of SAARC. The theme of the summit
was climate change. During this period, as SAARC Chair, Prime Minister
Thinley undertook extensive visits to all the SAARC member countries
in an effort to “ensure that the momentum and positive environment
generated by the Thimphu Summit are not lost and wasted.”187 Bhutan
appealed to the members and observers for cooperation to mitigate
the common challenges and also to give special attention to the vulnerable
smaller countries of the region. Thinley also appraised the members
that the “GNH establishes happiness as the ultimate purpose of
development.”188 Bhutan also played an important role in obtaining an
observer status for SAARC at COP 16 in Mexico in 2010 by sending
a message to the world community that South Asian countries are
together for mitigating their common challenges, including climate
change.189

While SAARC has been criticised for lack of performance, perpetually
on crutches due to intense rivalry between two of its members—India
and Pakistan—and while some of its members argue for inclusion of
non-South Asian countries as its members for better performance,
Bhutan affirmed a strong faith on SAARC’s capability and reiterated
its utility for resolving differences between the members. Bhutan’s
approach to regional cooperation was based on the realisation that
“national development objectives can be attained through collective
regional efforts. The ultimate goal was, however, more political and
strategic in nature. Bhutan realised that it was more important to enhance
its internal stability while at the same time projecting itself as a sovereign
and independent nation.”190 Emphasising on SAARC as a regional
organisation exclusively for the South Asian region, in an interview to
The Hindu in November 2014, Bhutan’s Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay
said:
This could be an occasion in realising the collective hopes of the
region to integrate and prosper together...if we did not have
bilateral differences, we would not need a SAARC. We need a
SAARC desperately to realise our collective potential because we
have differences. This forum provides for us to go beyond
individual differences and in doing so it provides us the platform
to reconcile them. Despite bilateral problems, leaders meet
because of the SAARC Summit.191
Bhutan also played an important role in bringing out a sub-regional
Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA), when the Kathmandu Summit failed
to endorse the regional MVA due to Pakistan’s reservations over the
issue. Bhutan, along with Bangladesh, Nepal and India signed the historic
Motor Vehicle Agreement (BBIN-MVA) in Bhutan for the “Regulation

The agreement encapsulates the spirit of economic integration
emphasised in the SAARC Charter. Before signing the agreement, BBIN
officials had a meeting in Kolkata in February 2015. The agreement
was endorsed by the cabinets of the respective countries. This agreement
is likely to yield maximum dividend for the two Himalayan landlocked
counties—Nepal and Bhutan. The agreement has addressed their long-
standing grievances concerning trade and transit issues with India. A
Bhutanese official reportedly stated that the agreement would “increase
people-to-people contact in the region” and boost trade and commerce
amongst the four countries.
Bhutan has remained committed towards regional cooperation,
development, and peace. In 2016, Bhutan along with Bangladesh and
Afghanistan supported India’s decision to not participate in the
Islamabad SAARC Summit due to Pakistan-supported militants’ attack
on the Indian military base in Uri on 18 September. Similarly, Bhutan
also supported other member countries’ views about not holding the
SAARC Summit during COVID-19 pandemic when Pakistan and
Nepal proposed holding of the same in the SAARC external affairs
virtual meeting in September 2020. Further, on the occasion of 36th
Charter Day of the SAARC, Bhutan’s foreign minister Lyonpo thanked
India for taking the lead to organise the SAARC Leaders’ Video
Conference in March 2020 to join hands to fight the pandemic and for
the establishment of the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund.192
BIMSTEC
Bhutan joined BIMSTEC in February 2004 after seven years of its
formation, and has benefitted by its area of cooperation, especially on
transportation and communication, tourism, environment and disaster
management, and agriculture. Bhutan is responsible for ensuring Cultural
Cooperation between member countries. Bhutan used the platform

to widen its diplomatic reach by meeting heads of the member states
on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC meetings. This provided an
opportunity for Bhutan to expand its economic cooperation beyond
India. For example, during the summit meeting at the Nay Pyi Taw,
Myanmar, in March 2014, Bhutan’s PM Tshering Tobgay discussed
about resuming direct flights with Myanmar by rerouting to Singapore
for getting more tourists. Both the countries also discussed about
exchange of students and cooperation on trade and agriculture. The
First BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting on Culture was held in Paro, Bhutan
from 23 to 25 May 2004. The meeting adopted the concept paper
prepared by Bhutan for cooperation in culture as the Paro Initiative to
serve as a roadmap for socio-economic progress driven by cultural
industries in the BIMSTEC region. In 2014 in the Myanmar meeting,
Bhutan signed the “Memorandum of Understanding on the
Establishment of the BIMSTEC Cultural Industries Observatory
(BCIO) and the BIMSTEC Cultural Industries Commission (BCIC)”.
The Cultural Industries Observatory will be located in Paro and will
serve as the repository for information on cultural industries, disseminate
such information and facilitate its access by member states.193 It is an
opportunity for Bhutan to extend its cultural linkages and share religious
values with three important member countries—Myanmar, Sri Lanka,
and Thailand—that have substantial followers of Buddhism. “Our
membership of the BIMSTEC is, therefore, an extension of our policy
of seeking closer economic cooperation, not only with our South Asian
neighbours but also with countries of South East Asia”.194
FINAL OBSERVATIONS
The objective of the first phase of diversification was to protect its
sovereignty and territorial integrity against external forces and to garner
international recognition without entanglement in international politics.

The second phase was mostly targeted at integrating the domestic
economy with the global market economy. In between the first and
second phases of diversification, and immediately after the first phase,
Bhutan’s monarchy also utilised the newly found external relations to
protect itself against the domestic democratic movement led by Nepal.
The King had to access his own challenges at home against the backdrop
of the democratic movement in Nepal. Bhutan suspected India may
support its Nepalese population, like the latter’s support to Nepali
Congress in Nepal. In the light of that, Bhutan voted against India in
NAM and the UN. Just before the completion of Chinese annexation
of Tibet in 1959, Bhutan had discussed with India its desire to diversify
its foreign policy perhaps to maintain a balance between India and
China and generating funds for economic development. During the
second phase of diversification, Bhutan asserted its international identity
and dealt both at the regional and international levels confidently.
Economic agendas dominated security issues.
Given the rapid changes in the world order and geo-political changes
in Asia, Bhutan’s foreign policy was readjusted accordingly. Despite
being a landlocked country, it is not immune to the influence of
globalisation. Therefore, the following trends are observed in Bhutan’s
foreign policy in the post-democracy period. First, Bhutan’s foreign
policy during the pre-democracy period was to some extent consistent
and adopted the traditional approach to deal with external issues. This
consistency was largely not carried forward with the introduction of
multi-party democracy despite the monarchy’s significant role in the
foreign policy making as enshrined in the 2008 Constitution. The choice
of foreign policy changed with the change of government in Thimphu.
As discussed earlier, the DPT and PDP took different foreign policy
approaches during their respective regimes. PM Thinley’s foreign policy
was mostly economically oriented and focused more on the international
level. On the contrary, Tobgay’s foreign policy was focused more at
the regional level and less at the international level. While the Thinley
government projected the GNH as cultural diplomacy to create a new
space for Bhutan before the international community, his successor
treated the GNH as a domestic issue. The DNT government took the
GNH as the guiding principle for improvement in rural health,
education, and women issues.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN | 107
Since coalition governments and political instability are part and parcel
of multi-party democracy in the sub-continent, Bhutan might witness
further dilution and incoherence in its foreign policy in the future.
A growing demand for linking Bhutan’s economy with China and the
US cannot be ruled out in the near future. There is already a growing
domestic demand that Bhutan should establish diplomatic relations
with China. India should not have any reservations on that because of
its own growing economic activities with China. Once the BCIM
corridor starts functioning, Bhutan might lobby for joining that to get
a direct benefit from both India and China and could use that route
for direct trade with China’s prosperous Yunnan province and Myanmar.
The Lhasa-Shigatse rail link to Yadong, could be a game-changer for
Bhutan to trade with China.195 Moreover, China is a global economic
power. Being a neighbour, Bhutan could take advantage of that.
Second, the foreign policy of Bhutan is now more driven by economic
imperatives rather than security, and this was quite evident during the
Thinley regime. Thinley tried to establish diplomatic relations with China,
despite being aware that China has been adopting undemocratic
methods to suppress Tibetan culture and freedom. At the same time,
China continues its claim on Bhutanese territory.
Third, an effort to create a new space in the international discourse on
measuring growth and happiness and protection of small states against
the threat of climate change has been another dimension of the new
foreign policy of Bhutan. At the same time, Bhutan has also focused
more on engaging with countries having a majority of Buddhist
followers. Therefore, Bhutan has frequent engagements with countries
located in South and South-Eastern region, mostly with the ASEAN
members, to attract tourists.

Lastly, Bhutan has been pursuing an independent foreign policy without
consulting India since 2007. However, the foreign policy is formulated
with due consideration of the security concerns of both Bhutan and
India. Efforts are also being made to reduce dependence on India in
terms of technological and financial assistance for infrastructure
development. In this regard, support of multilateral financial institutions
and other regional organisations are explored rather than just limiting
to establishing diplomatic relations with major powers in the region.

Chapter 4
C
ONCLUSION
Despite having common traits such as being landlocked, ruled by
monarchical systems till 2008, developing and weak economies,
mountainous terrain, and situated between India and China, the foreign
policy behaviours of Bhutan and Nepal exhibit differences. During
the pre-colonial period, external relations of these two countries were
mostly decided according to the agreements with the then British India.
According to the treaties, the foreign policy of both the Himalayan
countries was decided by British India. In the post-colonial period, the
two Himalayan countries entered into another round of agreements
with the Republic of India almost on similar lines. However, one major
difference was that India acknowledged these two countries as sovereign
and independent neighbours. Moreover, the foreign policy of both
the countries was mostly influenced by China’s claims on the Himalayan
region, including Nepal and Bhutan. Bhutan was more directly affected
by the Chinese annexation of Tibet than Nepal because of its deep
religio-cultural and economic interactions with Tibet. Therefore, when
China occupied Tibet and destroyed cultural institutions in Tibet, Bhutan
treated Chinese actions as an attack on its sovereignty. That was not the
case with Nepal.
According to the India–Nepal 1950 Treaty and the “exchange of letter”,
Nepal’s foreign, defence and economic policies were to be guided by
India under the so-called “special relationship”. Interestingly, instead
of comforting Nepal against external threats, the arrangement made
the ruling class of Nepal concerned about pursuing an independent
foreign policy. Therefore, by 1955, Nepal ignored some of the clauses
of the agreement and diversified its foreign policy by establishing
diplomatic relations with other countries and multilateral forums. There
were also other factors like domestic, regional, and international
developments at that time responsible for this foreign policy
diversification.
110 | NIHAR R. NAYAK
Similarly, Bhutan had signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty with India
in 1949. As per the Treaty, the foreign and defence policies of Bhutan
were to be guided by India. Bhutan had to consult India before
establishing any diplomatic relations with other countries. Unlike Nepal,
Bhutan had adopted a policy of limited external relations until 1961.
The then rulers of Bhutan adopted this policy to protect the sovereignty,
cultural identity, and political independence. Therefore, section 2 of
the 1949 Treaty did not affect the foreign policy of Bhutan much and
perhaps it was, to some extent, comfortable with the Treaty. However,
the geo-political dynamics changed rapidly with Chinese annexation
of Tibet in 1959 followed by India’s unsuccessful military campaigning
against China in the 1962 border conflict. These two events gave an
impression to Bhutan that its policy of limited external interaction might
not be relevant in the context of geo-political shifts in the Himalayan
region and growing inter-state relations due to development of
communication technology. Bhutan’s realisation to get out of isolationist
policy also coincided with India’s policy shifts towards capacity building
of the two Himalayan countries to resist spread of communism to
south of Himalayas and any military campaign in future. In this regard,
Nehru during his official visit to Bhutan in 1958, had offered economic
and technological assistance for socio-economic and infrastructure
development. Later, India supported Bhutan to join the Colombo
Plan in 1961 and the UN in 1971.
Given their geo-political similarities, cultural linkages and common
neighbours, historically, Bhutan has often adjusted its domestic and
foreign policy by monitoring political developments in Nepal. For
example, there was close relationship between the kings of Nepal and
Bhutan. The first Dharmaraja Syawadung Nawang Namgyal introduced
some political system in Bhutan after completing visits to the Gorkha
kingdom. “The system of ‘Mana-panthi’ of Gorkha’s known as ‘Gorge
Jhappa’ among the Dukpa and Pyapsa people of Bhutan has been
popularised in Bhutan.”196 There were also linkages between the Ranas

of Nepal and Dorji clan of Bhutan. Both the clans had occupied prime
ministerial position in the monarchical system in their respective countries.
Lhendup Dorji, former acting Prime Minister of Bhutan, had fled to
Nepal in 1965 and took political asylum when his conspiracy against
the King was exposed. It is believed that Lhendup and his brother
were supported by China. Lhendup got the support of King Mahendra
of Nepal, who suspected India’s role behind promoting democracy in
Nepal at that time. This reflected that Bhutan did not follow complete
isolation in its foreign policy. Rather, it had selective foreign policy vis-
à-vis Buddhist and small countries. Until the issue of Lhotshampa became
serious in 1990 in Bhutan, both the countries had close cultural and
economic interactions.
Despite having a close and dependent relationship, as was the case
with the Kings in Nepal, the King of Bhutan was also suspicious about
India’s support to Lhotshampas, who demanded democracy and
abolition of the feudal system. The formation of Bhutan State Congress
(BSC) at Patgaon in Goalpara district of Assam in November 1952
(which drew inspiration from Indian National Congress and the Nepali
Congress) with demand of closer ties with India, Bhutan’s doubt about
India’s support increased. Like the NC of Nepal, the BSC also used
Indian territory to carry out its democratic movement in Bhutan.197
There were close relations and exchange of ideas between two parallel
democratic movements in Nepal and Bhutan. Therefore, Bhutan
followed the Nepal King’s footsteps to diversify its external relations
to reduce dependence on India and to minimise India’s influence in its
domestic politics. While Nepal established relationship with China and
other major powers for international recognition and support as an
independent country, Bhutan almost adopted a similar policy with some
calculative moves by keeping a balance between India’s security interest
and its own political independence. Instead of establishing linkages
with major powers and China, it preferred to become a member of
multilateral forums such as the Colombo Plan, UN, NAM, SAARC,

etc. In terms of bilateral relations, it again preferred to establish
diplomatic relations with small countries whose relationship in turn
with Bhutan did not affect India’s security concerns.
Both Nepal and Bhutan carried out their foreign policy diversification
in three phases. In the first phase (1947–1950), other than domestic
issues, security concerns had dominated the foreign policy of both the
countries. In the second phase of foreign policy diversification (1955–
1985), they concentrated on protecting the monarchy against democratic
movements and reducing dependence on India. In the third phase
(1990 onwards), the Himalayan countries focused mainly on integrating
their respective domestic market with the global economy and rapid
search of external resources for socio-economic development.
Therefore, both the Himalayan countries’ quest for FDI and technology
would continue under the multi-party democratic system. As a result,
security issue would have less priority. In this scenario, while Nepal
already has a robust diversified foreign policy; it is now Bhutan’s turn
to venture into some new relationships to fulfil its political and economic
aspirations. Both the countries have also witnessed that despite having
adopted diversified foreign policy and liberal economic policy to attract
FDI, the actual foreign investment has been below their expectations.
In this regard, to attract more FDI and cater to their growing domestic
demands, they would prefer multilateral arrangements to overcome
the problems faced at the bilateral levels. They would also prefer taking
advantage of the economic growth of India and China. At the same
time, they would use multilateral forums like UN, LDC and LLDC to
raise their demands for trade and transit concessions, and special
protections against the impact of climate change. However, the success
of foreign policy for Bhutan and Nepal would depend on domestic
political stability and consensus amongst the major political parties. At
the regional level, these countries will push for bilateral trade with
immediate neighbours and regional energy integration to explore
multiple options to attract foreign investments and market.

T
he two Himalayan states—Nepal and Bhutan—adopted a new
political system in 2008. Nepal upgraded the existing multiparty
system by excluding the monarchy. Therefore, Nepal had
Constituent Assembly elections in May 2008. Similarly, keeping pace
with the geopolitical changes in the Himalayas, Bhutan adopted
POLITICAL CHANGES
democracy with constitutional monarchy under the new Constitution.
These changes had an impact on their approach to diplomatic relations.
In Nepal, there was a strong domestic demand to adopt a new set of
foreign policies to negotiate bilateral issues with other countries as an
IN
equal partner, diversify investment market for rapid economic growth, and
re-negotiate the existing treaties.
Bhutan wanted to build a new image at the global level by ending the
traditional approach of depending on others. In this regard, the key NEPAL AND BHUTAN
foreign policy drivers of Bhutan have been: (I) diversifying investment
sources by reducing dependence on foreign aid, and (II) adopting a
proactive role in climate change negotiation, and popularising the
Emerging Trends in Foreign Policy
concept of Gross National Happiness. In this context, the Monograph
analyses new trends in the foreign policy approach of elected
in Post 2008 Period
governments of these Himalayan countries under the new political
arrangement.
Dr Nihar R. Nayak is Research Fellow with MP-IDSA, New
Delhi. His area of expertise is climate change impact in the
Himalayas, Maoist conflict, political violence, and
cooperative security in South Asia. Dr Nayak has completed
Ph.D. in International Politics from Jawaharlal Nehru
University. He was Visiting Fellow to PRIO, Oslo, in 2006
and 2007. He did a special course on Peace Research in International
Summer School from the University of Oslo in 2007. He was Visiting
Faculty at the Center for the Study of Nepal, Faculty of Social Science, Nihar R. Nayak
Banaras Hindu University in 2011. He was also Guest Faculty at
LBSNAA, Mussoorie from 2006 to 2011. Dr Nayak has both national and
international publications including the book Strategic Himalayas:

Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
FOREWORD
Measuring the size and economic contribution of tourism in a country is an important
endeavour but at the same time an ambitious and a tedious process as it is difficult to
capture all the contributions of tourism in an economy given the diverse and cross cutting
nature of the tourism sector.
The Tourism Council of Bhutan is pleased to present the Tourism Establishment Census
of Bhutan (TECOB) 2021 which will complement our efforts towards the development
of a proper System of Tourism Statistics (STS) for Bhutan. It will also help with the
measurement of tourism’s economic contribution to the economy and enhance and
improve the availability of supply side tourism statistics in the country.
TECOB 2021 is the first census of the Tourism Establishments in the country and
provides a wealth of information that will enhance our understanding of the operations
of the establishments within the tourism industry in Bhutan. The publication contains the
economy-wide results of the tourism establishments in Bhutan covering major tourism
industries namely: Accommodation, Food and Beverage Service Activities, Transport
Operators, Tour and Travel Agencies, Health and Wellness, and other Tourism Activities.
The report presents statistics on the tourism establishments, type of establishments,
geographical distributions, employment, available facilities and services and clienteles
amongst other. It also includes analyses of tourism establishments and statistical tables.
I hope that the TECOB 2021 report will provide insights and necessary information
for policy makers, planners, the business community, and international partners to
understand and contribute to tourism development. I would like to extend my sincere
appreciation to the owners and managers of the establishments and all the officials who
administered the census, for their support and cooperation.

a) Tourism expenditure on the product should represent a significant share of total
tourism expenditure (share of expenditure/demand condition);

Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION, CENSUS
METHODOLOGY & OPERATIONS
Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon related to the movement of people
to places outside their usual place of residence to a different country or a different place
within the country, pleasure being the usual motivation. These activities represent the
actions and behaviours of people in preparation for and during a trip in their capacity as
consumers. The activities carried out by a visitor during the travel results in an economic
activity through the acquisition of goods and services creating demand for growth of such
businesses and other related businesses.
Tourism is considered as a driver and contributor to the economic growth of a country.
As an important economic sector, tourism has an impact on the economy, the natural and
built environment, the local population at the places visited and the visitors themselves.
Owing to this range of impacts and the wide range of stakeholders involved, there is a
need for a holistic approach to tourism development, management and monitoring. Only
with timely and adequate data that generate credible statistics, it is possible to undertake
different types of analysis of tourism. This is essential in order to evaluate the different
aspects of tourism and to support and improve policy decision-making.
Tourism statistics are necessary for designing marketing strategies, strengthening inter-
institutional relations, evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of management decisions
and measuring tourism throughout the national economy.
Towards this end, the Tourism Council of Bhutan (TCB) has initiated the development
of a proper System of Tourism Statistics (STS) for Bhutan to provide a basic framework
for coordinating and integrating statistical information on tourism including statistics on
national tourism to support evidence based policy formulation, development planning,
marketing and promotion, monitoring and evaluation and regulation. The development
of STS will also provide a sound basis and foundation to compute Tourism Satellite
Account (TSA) for Bhutan to measure the size and contribution of tourism to the national
economy.
Background of the census
In order to understand and describe supply side of the tourism in the country, it is
important to understand the supply of consumption goods and services that the visitors
might demand. Tourism supply is the direct provision to visitors of the goods and services
that make up tourism expenditure and economic contribution of tourism. Establishment
- 20 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
is used as the unit which provides data for the analyses of production and production
processes.
Establishment is defined operationally as ‘an enterprise’, or part of an enterprise, that
is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive activity is carried
out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added.
While some dispersed and fragmented basic information exist in the pockets of various
sectors on tourism establishments, there is no comprehensive official information on
tourism industries. Without the information and statistics on tourism establishment it
will be difficult to ascertain the significance of tourism to the national economy and also
undertake basic analysis and assessments.
The Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan (TECOB) 2021 was initiated to assess the
characteristics of the tourism establishments in the country and to provide data on tourism
characteristic establishments. TECOB is a nationwide census of establishments in the
formal sector engaged in tourism characteristics and health and wellness industries.
TECOB is a complete enumeration of tourism establishments at a point in time with
respect to well-defined tourism characteristic industries operating in the country. The
census collects information on the available supply of tourism goods, products and
services in the country.
The tourism industry in the country has grown over the years to become one of the major
economic sectors contributing significantly towards socioeconomic development of the
country. This development has led to the growth in business and establishment in the
tourism industry and related industries. The current and the future census shall enable
the government to measure the changing pattern and structure of the tourism industry.
The TCB conducted the first TECOB in March-April 2021 with financial support of
the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) Trust Fund and RGOB and with technical
assistance from the National Statistics Bureau (NSB).
The census collected basic information for all tourism establishments in operation
during the period of census enumeration to primarily generate supply side indicators
that will complement the demand side data towards the development of TSA for Bhutan.
The census will be implemented with the objective of getting data from establishments
that provide services to the tourist in various sub-sectors such as accommodation, food,
beverage and entertainment, transport, tour operators and other tourism establishments
such as retail shops/services, taxi drivers etc.
- 21 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
Objective
The main objective of TECOB 2021 is to assess the characteristics of the tourism
establishments in the country and to provide data on tourism characteristic establishments.
The census has the following specific objectives:
• Provide data on the supply and capacity in terms of facilities and services
• Gather data on employment by sex, hours of work, occupation and nationality
• Gather data on revenue generated from both domestic and inbound tourists
• Provide key information for TSA
Scope and coverage
The TECOB is a nationwide census of establishments in the formal sector engaged in
tourism characteristic industries in 2019. Tourism industries comprise all establishments
for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic activity. The household-based
establishments like Taxi and Travel Agent / Tour Operators were also covered in this
census.
Tourism characteristic industries as defined in the IRTS 2008 (International
Recommendation of Tourism Statistics) as follows;
• Tourism characteristic activities: Tourism characteristic activities are the activities
that typically produce tourism characteristic products. As the industrial origin of a
product (the ISIC industry that produces it) is not a criterion for the aggregation of
products within a similar CPC category, there is no strict one-to-one relationship
between products and the industries producing them as their principal outputs
(IRTS 2008, para. 5.11).
• Tourism characteristic products: Tourism characteristic products are those that
satisfy one or both of the following criteria (IRTS 2008, para. 5.10). a) Tourism
expenditure on the product should represent a significant share total tourism
expenditure (share-of-expenditure/demand condition); b) Tourism expenditure
on the product should represent a significant share of the supply of the product in
the economy (share-of-supply condition). This criterion implies that the supply of
a tourism characteristic product would cease to exist in meaningful quantity in the
absence of visitors.
Tourism connected industries are excluded from the coverage of the TECOB.

Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
Census Methodology and Operations
• Frame
The frame for the TECOB is the list of establishments that were operational in 2019.
The Economic Census of Bhutan conducted by NSB was used as benchmark for the
development of the frame. Due to lack of proper list / frame for Taxi, the fresh listing
of 2,991 Taxis was carried out by the field supervisors and enumerators.
• Sampling Design of Household-based Establishments
This mainly comprise of taxis. The sample size of 408 was determined based on p=0.5,
which was 14% of the total population listed. A stratified sampling was adopted to
provide estimates and Taxis in Dzongkhags were selected using Simple Random
Sampling. Out of 408 Taxis 298 completed the interviews and non-response rate was
adjusted to derive weight and calculate estimates at national level.
• Unit of enumeration
The unit of enumeration are the establishments. An establishment is defined as
an economic unit, which engages, under a single ownership or control, in one or
predominantly one kind of economic activity at a single fixed physical location.
• Data collection
The data was collected from tourism establishments through CAPI/PAPI interviews
during the months of March and April 2021.
Follow-ups were done through telephones to validate and seek additional clarifications
on the data collected.
• Main outputs
The main outputs of the TECOB is to gather data on the number of tourism
characteristic establishment, employment in the tourism industry and revenue
generated.
• Employment size
The size of an economic unit is determined by its total employment (TE) as of specific
date. Total employment (TE) refers to the total number of persons who work in or for
- 23 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
the establishment. This includes paid employees, working owners, unpaid workers
and all employees who work full-time or part-time including seasonal workers.
Included also are persons on short term leave such as those on sick, vacation or
annual leaves.
• Key results

• Classifications and definitions:
The classifications and definitions used are consistent with:
o World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) international recommendations
on Tourism Statistics
o National Statistics Bureau (NSB) definitions and concepts
• Survey Instrument
• Questionnaire
Since the TECOB was being conducted for the first time in Bhutan, the UNWTO
guidelines ‘International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008’ was
used as the primary resource. In addition, other countries’ census and surveys
on tourism establishments including questionnaires were reviewed for drafting
of the census questionnaire. Different versions of the questionnaire were drafted
and discussed with stakeholders.
The main questionnaires used contained the following modules:
o Accommodation
o Food, Beverage and Entertainment / Restaurants
o Transport operators / Tour or travel agents
o Health and wellness
o Other tourism activities
- 24 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
The international standards, concepts and definitions as well as national
requirements were considered in the development of the questionnaire. The
consultation workshop with relevant stakeholders were conducted on the draft
questionnaire before finalizing.
• Manuals
Following the finalization of the questionnaires, field manuals were developed to
guide the enumerators and supervisors during the enumeration. These manuals
also provide the basis for the enumerators and supervisor training before the
enumeration.
Enumerators Manual: The manual comprises the concepts and definitions used,
interview procedures and detail explanation on the questions.
Supervisors Manual: The manual comprises detailed instructions to ensure data
quality as well as field enumeration procedures.
• Pre-Test
The questionnaires and manuals were tested in a pilot census and revised on the
evaluation of the pilot experience.
• Selection and Training of Census staff
For the TECOB, 13 supervisors and 52 enumerators were recruited who were working
in the tourism industry and who had prior experience in data collection using CAPI.
A week long training program covering census methodology, questionnaire, concepts
and definitions and use of data capturing applications was conducted. During the
training, the census staff were introduced to the general backgrounds of the census
and the concepts and definitions of the terms contained in the questionnaire. They
were also trained in the various enumeration procedures and in recording responses
to the questionnaire electronically in the tablets provided to them. Mock interviews
in different dialects were conducted among the enumerators to equip them with
interviewing techniques during the training sessions. At the end of the training
period, they were sent for a field test to get further practical experience and get
adapted with the tablet and the questionnaire before the actual census enumeration.
- 25 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
• Field Operations
The enumerators and supervisors were divided into 13 teams based on the
establishment listing and the geographical locations. Each team was led by a
supervisor and was deployed in the field for a period of 31 days. The field data
collection as done using CAPI method. The data consistency checks were done by
the supervisors during the field enumerations and approved by head office on a daily
basis. Incomplete and unclear questionnaires were sent back to the supervisors and
enumerators by the HQ for completion.
In cases where the enumerators were not able to locate the establishment, follow-ups
through phone calls and emails were carried out after the completion of the field
operations
• Data processing and analysis
The questionnaire was designed in the survey solutions application developed by the
World Bank. The data were exported from the survey solution server. The coding and
revalidation were done by coders at the head office.
The further data validation, cleaning and tabulation were done using statistical
software (STATA) ver.15.
• Analysis and Reporting
During the census preparation phase, a detailed outline and tabulation plan was
developed. Upon completion of an operational data set, a set of basic tables were
produced in accordance with the tabulation plan. This was used as a basis for the
presentation and analysis of results in the census report.
The analysis results and report chapters that were produced by the census team
underwent several rounds of internal review before finalization.
• Census Quality Assurance
In order to ensure the quality of the census, international standards and procedures
for conducting a Tourism Establishment Census including application of relevant
international classifications (UNWTO) and national classifications (NSB) have been
used consistently throughout the census enumeration and reporting.
- 26 -
Tourism Establishment Census of Bhutan 2021
Further, the results of the TECOB was validated with experts from NSB for final
reporting.
Limitations of the census
• Many of the listed establishments could not be enumerated, mostly because they
were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or were seasonally inactive, could
not be located, or refused to respond during the census. This amounts to 16.17%
of the tourism establishments targeted by the census.

CHAPTER 3 – ACCOMMODATION
1. Introduction
Accommodation Services refers to an enterprise or business unit providing rooms for
short-term rentals for tourists / travelers. It includes hotels, resorts, village homestays,
etc. and includes provision of meals and other related services to their clienteles.
Accommodation establishments are key variables in the tourism sector and to a large
extent influence the development of tourism in the destinations.
Currently the accommodation services in Bhutan are categorized as TCB certified
accommodations and non-TCB certified accommodations catering to Non-MDPR
paying tourists and locals. Given this situation, it was difficult to determine the frame
for non-TCB certified accommodations. However, after taking over the mandates of the
non-certified hotels, TCB is in the process of working on a national accommodation
system whereby all accommodation services in the country will be classified and certified
through a single accommodation system. This will enable us to develop a comprehensive
frame for all accommodations services in the country. The categories of hotels under the
TCB certified accommodations are 5-star accommodation, 4-star accommodation, 3-star
accommodation and Village Homestays. Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in the tourism
sector is currently only in 4-star and 5-star accommodation sector. There are a total of 20
FDI hotels operational in the country.
Accommodation /hotel classification systems are widely used in the accommodation
sector as a means of providing an indicator to both consumers and intermediaries on the
standards to be found at individual establishments.
2. Number of Establishment
There were a total of approximately 939 accommodation services operational in 2019.
However, many of these accommodation establishments could not be enumerated
mainly because they were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or were seasonally
inactive, could not be located, or refused to respond during the census. A total of 573
accommodations were covered during the census.

FOREWORD
The Tourism Council of Bhutan is pleased to present the annual statistical publication
‘Bhutan Tourism Monitor 2020’. This publication presents the overall performance of
tourism for the year including data on market trends, findings and analysis to support
future development of the tourism industry.
After recording continued growths over the years, visitor arrivals to Bhutan in 2020 was at
a record low with 29,812 arrivals which is 90.55% drop from the previous high of 2019. The
earnings from tourism has also seen a drop of 88% in 2020.
This decline is mainly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent travel
restrictions and closure of borders by countries across the globe bringing travel and
tourism to a complete halt. The COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create
unprecedented impacts on the economy and lives of people in Bhutan and around the
world with travel and tourism being one of the severely impacted industries.
As we strive to work towards recovery, it is only imperative for the need to re-think on our
development aspects to make our industry more sustainable and resilient. And what better
way than to strengthen and build on the time-tested tourism policy of High value, Low
Volume which is more significant and pertinent now than ever before.
I am hopeful that the BTM 2020 will provide necessary information on tourism for the
formulation of plans and programs.

COVID-19 AND TOURISM IN BHUTAN
The coronavirus pandemic has created and continues to create unprecedented impacts on
the economy and livelihoods in the country and around the world. The detection of the first
imported positive case in early March 2020 in the country and the subsequent imposition
of travel restrictions has brought the tourism industry to a standstill with tourism being one
of the worst hit.
Impact of COVID-19
Visitor arrivals
Overall visitor arrivals fell by 91 percent, with only 29,812 visitors in 2020 as compared to
315,599 visitors in 2019. Of this, 6,376 were MDPR paying tourists (a 90.5 percent drop
2019); and 23,436 were Non-MDPR paying tourists (a 90 percent drop from 2019).

Gross receipts fell by 92 percent to USD 19.84million in 2020, from USD 225.87million in
2019.Direct revenue also dropped by 90.4 percent to USD 2.76million in 2020, from USD
23.42million in 2019.
Employment

related industries have been impacted by the pandemic facing problems meeting overhead
costs, loan repayments and other fixed costs with no source of income.
14 | Planning and Research, Tourism Council of Bhutan
Bhutan Tourism Monitor 2020
Interventions
Considering these unprecedented impacts, tourism was identified as one of the focus
sectors for interventions. The interventions focused on addressing and mitigating the
impacts of the pandemic and to work towards recovery through the implementation of
programs on infrastructure and product development, training and re-skilling, survey and
studies and waste management. These programs were implemented through the Economic
Contingency Plan (ECP) I, ECP II and implementation of the re-prioritised Tourism Flagship
Program.
Some of the major intervention areas are follows:
• Adoption of Tourism Levy Act of Bhutan 2020 and Tourism Policy of the Kingdom of
Bhutan 2021.
• Rules and regulations for implementation of Tourism Levy Act of Bhutan 2020, Action
plan for Tourism Policy, guidelines for reopening tourism in a safe manner, guidelines
for domestic tourism management and others have been undertaken.
• Development, promotion and implementation of communication plan to maintain and
promote Brand Bhutan through various local and international channels including social
media, print media, television and videos.
• Digitalisation of the tourism industry has been initiated through the integration of online
systems to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery.
The digitalisation will look into establishment of one-stop-service-center, TCB hub for
system integration within and beyond TCB, enhancement of online payment system
and online communication systems, among others.
• Samdrup Jongkhar and Gelephu identified as additional entry points to prepare for
the reopening of the sector, and to facilitate the spread of tourists across the country.
Integrated check post facilities will be set up in these locations in due course of time.
• Development of Druk Neykor connecting 108 temples in the country has been initiated.
The Thimphu version comprising 16 sites (temples and neys) has been launched on
December 17, 2020.
• Digitalisation of trekking routes (snowman trek) including enhancement of trek routes
(for example Sinchula and Gangtey trail).
• Development of proper system of tourism statistics (BSTS) including Bhutan
experimental tourism satellite account (BETSA). This includes enhancement of tourism
statistics on inbound, domestic and outbound tourism (first domestic and outbound
tourism survey (DOTS) conducted in 2020).
• Proposal to enhance visitor experiences post COVID-19 through diversification of
tourism products such as wellness, nature, culture, and MICE has been developed.
• Training and re-skilling include training on wellness, meditation, Spa and Sowa Rigpa,
hotel assessors training, cultural guides, re-skilling of handicraft craftsman, foreign

Bhutan Tourism Monitor 2020
CHAPTER 1 – OVERVIEW
Introduction
Bhutan Tourism Monitor (BTM) is an annual statistical publication of the Tourism Council
of Bhutan presenting a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the tourism industry
during the calendar year. The report presents statistical insights on the visitor, first-hand
feedback from the visitors and past tourism trends and analysis. TCB continuously strives
to publish improved and relevant publications for its stakeholders in the travel and tourism
industry and beyond to meet the data needs of these diverse groups of users.
However, the global tourism industry including tourism in Bhutan has been severely
impacted by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 bringing travel and tourism to a complete
standstill affecting businesses and people working in the industry. Bhutan introduced travel
restrictions from 6th March 2020 after the detection of the first COVID-19 case and since
then the travel restriction is in place with no visitor arrivals.
The BTM 2020 presents the data for the period covering 1st January till 6th March 2020
supplemented by the visitor exit survey administered at the entry ports during the months
of January till March 2020. The report presents the detailed statistical breakdown of visitor
arrivals, visitor profiles and demographics, travel patterns and interests, expenditure and
tourism receipts including tourism trends, analysis and market intelligence.
Objectives
The objective of the annual statistical publication is to provide comprehensive and reliable
information on the state and performance of the tourism industry for the calendar year
2020.
Study Design and Methodology
The tourism statistics in BTM 2020 is reported on a calendar year basis although the data
coverage is for 1st January till 6th March 2020. There were some officials and visiting
friends and relatives arrivals after 6th March 2020. The secondary data is obtained from
Tashel Information Management System, a database maintained by TCB and Immigration
database maintained by the Department of Immigration (DOI). The data presented in
the past annual tourism monitors were also used while making trend analysis on various
variables.
16 | Planning and Research, Tourism Council of Bhutan
Bhutan Tourism Monitor 2020
The primary data were collected through visitor exit survey (VES) administered at the
Paro International Airport and Phuentsholing Integrated Outpost targeting all departing
tourists/visitors. Primary data was collected using exit survey questionnaires comprising of
both open-ended and closed-ended questions which was designed and interviewed using
Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI). The data cleaning, cross tabulation, table
generation and data analysis were carried out in statistical software Stata SE - 15.
Sampling Frame
The sampling frame for the visitor exit survey 2020 was developed based on the 315,559
tourists who departed the country in 2019 through the two major exit points namely Paro
airport by air and Phuentsholing by land.
Sampling Design
Two stage systematic cluster design was adopted for the Visitors Exit Survey of Bhutan
2020 to provide estimates on international tourists related indicators at national level. Two
stages were identified for sampling wherein first stage included 12 weeks selection using
systematic random sampling from week 1 up to week 52 with a sampling interval of 4 and
a random start of any number from 1 to 52 to capture the seasonality in the data; and in
the second stage the required numbers of tourists were selected using systematic random
sampling in each sampled week.
Sample Size Determination
In order to estimate the required sample size, a criterion variable was decided upon which
the estimation was based. It was decided that estimation of the required sample size be
based on the mean of length of stay in the country (regional and international tourists).
The required sample size was estimated using the number of tourist arrivals in 2019 on the
mean length of stay in the country.
The formula for sample size is as follow:
Planning and Research, Tourism Council of Bhutan | 17
Bhutan Tourism Monitor 2020
where:
n is the parameter to be calculated and is the sample size in terms of number of
tourists to be selected;
z is the statistic that defines the level of confidence desired (95% confidence interval);
s is the variance length of stay by visitors;
f is the sample design effect, assumed to be 2.0;
k is a multiplier to account for the anticipated rate of non-response;
p is the proportion of the total population accounted for by the target population and
upon which the parameter, r, is based (r pertains to the variable length of stay);
e is the acceptable margin of error in estimating p.
Based on the above formula, the total sample size was estimated at 5,202 individuals
(non-resident tourists) at the national level.
Survey Limitations
The VES 2020 covered only January till March 2020 and the statistical tables / charts and
analysis relating to VES 2020 covers data collected for these months only.
