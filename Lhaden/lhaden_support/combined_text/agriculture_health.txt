PART I: INTRODUCTION
1. Health and Development
Bhutan has achieved remarkable health development since the
advent of modern health care in the early 1960’s. Bhutan has
sustained primary health care coverage at above 90 % (Percentage
of population within 3 hrs walking distance each way to a health
service delivery point).
Consequently, Life expectancy rose from 37 years in 1960 to 66
years in 2005 and infant mortality rates dropped from 103 per
1000 live births in 1984 to 40.1 per 1000 in 2005 (Office of the Census
Commissioner, 2005).
Further, Bhutan declared Universal Childhood Immunization
in 1991 and has sustained immunization coverage of above 90
percent. Similarly, access to safe drinking water and sanitation
has improved drastically over the years and in 2011, 83% of the
population has access to safe drinking water and 91% to safe
excreta disposal (Ministry of Health, 2011).
Bhutan is also well on its way to attaining most of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Despite its rugged terrain and
limited resources, these achievements in health indicators make
Bhutan a model and a pioneer for promotion of primary health
care.
These achievements in the overall health has been brought about
primarily by the far-sighted leadership of our monarchs; focus
on primary health care approach; integrated well functioning
traditional and modern health system; socio-economic growth;
increase in literacy rate; and the pursuit of balanced development
path guided by the philosophy of Gross National Happiness
(GNH).
The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) continues to accord
high priority to the provision of equitable and quality universal
access to free health care services including referral of patients
1
abroad for life saving treatments beyond the clinical capacity
and facilities available in Bhutan.
The Section 21 and 22 under Article 9 of the constitution of the
Kingdom of Bhutan states that, “the state shall provide free access
to basic public health services in both modern and traditional
medicines” and “the state shall endeavor to provide security in
the event of sickness and disability or lack of adequate means
of livelihood for reasons beyond one’s control” respectively
stands as a testament to the Government’s commitment in the
provision of free and quality universal health care.
Health has held a prominent place in Bhutan’s economic
development where the government spends around 7.4 to 11.4%
of total government expenditure on health (Policy and Planning
Division, 2009). As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
public health spending alone (not counting private health
expenditure) constitutes approximately 4% (V.selvaraju, Wangmo,
Wangchuk, & Dendup, 2009-10).
While Bhutan has overcome many obstacles in the past, it now
confronts new and varied challenges such as 1) rising health
care expenditure; 2) changing life style and disease pattern; 3)
inadequate human resources; 4) changing political environment;
5) Increasingly evolving health care needs of the population; 6)
international health obligations and 7) new health technologies.
Despite numerous challenges, it is envisioned that the National
Health Policy shall set the agenda and provide general direction to
guide the government in achieving the national and international
health goals within the spirit of social justice and equity.
2. Vision and Mission
2.1. Vision
Build a healthy and happy nation through a dynamic
professional health system, attainment of highest standard
of health by the people within the broader framework of
2
overall national development in the spirit of social justice,
and equity.
2.2. Mission
Achievement of national health goals through sustained
provision of quality general and public health services.
3. Aspirations
Bhutan recognizes health as a prerequisite for economic and
spiritual development, poverty reduction and the road to Gross
National Happiness. The National Health Policy aspires to be
congruent with the philosophy of Gross National Happiness and
reflects various inputs ranging from social, spiritual, cultural and
environmental aspects.
It recognizes the values of democracy, transparency, and equity
especially addressing the needs of the poor and underprivileged
through partnership in health. It also aspires to further pursue
decentralization policy in the delivery of health services to its
population.
It aims to promote self-reliance and sustainability by increasing
efficiency, productivity, accountability and ownership in health
care interventions and service delivery.
This policy is gender-sensitive, respects the rights of the people,
seeks informed consent and maintains confidentiality in relation
to medical decision-making and information sharing.
This policy ultimately aspires to improve the health outcomes
by translating these statements into strategic framework through
collective national and international efforts.

Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Royal Government of Bhutan is examining alternatives for a sustainability strategy and is se-
riously committed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its health spending. Also, there
are rising citizen expectations from public services and the increasing public pressure to improve
efficiency and effectiveness of services.
This report is the outcome of a study undertaken, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, to obtain
information about the costs of delivering health services at different levels in Bhutan in order to:
• Inform MOH of the cost of delivering various types of services at different levels;
• Increase cost-awareness and knowledge;
• Inform the policy process and input to decision making
The study reviewed the costs and activity in 9 districts covering a total of 13 facilities including
the National Referral Hospital, the two Regional Referral Hospitals, four district hospitals and six
basic health units (three grade I and three grade II BHUs).
The study uses an easily replicable methodology to assess the cost of resources used to provide
services. It is based on data compiled for the period July 2009 to June 2010 thus covering the
financial year 2009/10. For the purpose of the study a standard costing model was developed.
The model classified health facility services into three types: overhead, intermediate and final.
Overhead services included all administrative services. Intermediate services covered various
support function like investigative services, kitchen, etc. The final type includes outpatient and
inpatient services.
In the first step of the study all costs were collected – both recurrent and capital costs. The capi-
tal items had its cost annualized to an annual depreciation cost. Then all costs were assigned to
the three types of cost centers. According to various rules the costs of overhead and intermedi-
ate services were allocated to final or direct service providing departments. Based on the final
costs and activity of these departments unit costs for services could be calculated.
Presented below is a summary of the key findings and recommendations. In general the results
and facility comparisons of the study should be interpreted with caution. There are many factors
influencing the final unit costs of facilities from quality of data, demand for services, case-mix of
patients, geographical features just being some of them. However, even taking this into consid-
eration the results of the study can be used to fulfill the objectives.

Main results and observations
• Costs and cost-structures at facilities. The study gives a detailed insight into total costs,
cost-structures and composition of costs of facilities at various levels. Recurrent costs gen-
erally across all levels have the highest share of total costs with salaries being the main
cost element. In general the share of fixed costs is relatively high. This means that to a
certain point the marginal cost of treating more patients will be relatively low. Hence an
effective and efficient use of resources is secured by maximizing use of fixed costs. This
requires on one hand a tool to assist in controlling patient flows – like an effective referral
system – and on the other hand the necessary information to adapt inputs/resources to
actual demand for services.
• Unit costs. The costs of OPD-visits, admissions in general as well as disease-specific group-
ings of admissions have been calculated and shows – as would be expected – that services
are generally more costly at higher levels. An OPD-visit is generally four times as costly at a
referral hospital compared to a BHU and twice as costly compared to a district hospital. In-
patients unit costs show the same pattern. The average inpatient cost of a referral hospital
is about three times that of a BHU and more than one-half time that of a district hospital.
• Cost-effectiveness. Providing services at the lowest effective level of service delivery (fa-
cilities) is the most cost-effective way of providing services in the long run. It is a challenge
to control demand for services and channel the patients to the right facilities. If this is
managed, it will in the longer run result in cost savings.
• Cost-efficiency. More optimal and cost efficient options for assigning manpower to facili-
ties are available and if pursued could result in both cost cutting and reductions in waiting
times for patients.
• Data issues. In general a huge amount of health related data is available in Bhutan. The
costing study reviewed a lot of these sources extensively and the review and analysis con-
ducted as a part of the study especially uncovered two areas that would benefit greatly
from renewed focus and improvements. These were the Bhutanese Health Management
and Information System (BHMIS) and the data management of equipments and drugs at
the Drugs, Vaccines and Equipment Division (DVED) of the MOH.
Way forward – and recommendations
This study is the first comprehensive attempt to do costing analysis in Bhutan. As such it should
be seen as a starting point for further analysis in specific areas like for example costing of diag-
nostic services.
The results can be used as input in the design of new policies. If the current political discussions
regarding charging non-Bhutanese for health services are pursued the results of the unit costing
can be used to set tariffs.

Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
In addition to the above mentioned areas/options for using the results, there are especially two
other areas where the analysis points towards possibilities of efficiency gains and cost cutting.
These are firstly a revision – or development - of the referral system and secondly further ana-
lyze productivity at the facilities.
It is therefore recommended to:
• Analyze options for developing and implementing a referral system for elective services
in Bhutan that embraces cost-effective provision of services by channeling the patients
to facilities with the lowest level of effective service delivery. – If the service needed by
a patient is provided at a district hospital the patient should in principle not receive it
at a referral hospital.
• Further analyze productivity – especially in terms of allocated manpower – in order to
more effectively align staff allocations with actual output of the facilities. This will both
ensure a more cost efficient use of resources as well as reducing waiting times in “over-
populated” facilities.

2. INTRODUCTION
The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) is examining alternatives for a sustainability strategy
and is seriously committed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its health spending.
Also, there are rising citizen expectations from public services and the increasing public pressure
to improve efficiency and effectiveness of services. As a follow up to the preparatory activities
undertaken in 2009-10, including a national workshop on sustainable Health Financing in Janu-
ary 2010 followed by the country’s participation in a regional health financing workshop in Mal-
dives in June 2010, the RGoB, with support from the World Bank and other development part-
ners has embarked on a Public Expenditure Review (PER) exercise for the Human Development
sectors of health, education and social protection in Bhutan, with an aim to provide evidence to
inform policy development in line with the sectoral priorities.
This report is the outcome of a study undertaken, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, to obtain
information about the costs of delivering health services in Bhutan. It comes at a time where
other initiatives in the area of health care financing are taking place. This includes a National
Health Accounts study and a Public Expenditure Review (PER).
The results of the study can be used as an input in the investigation of various health financing
options and in the pursuit of cost-containment and cost-effective options for health service de-
livery in Bhutan. The results can help increase cost-awareness and general knowledge to inform
the policy process.
The study reviewed the costs and activity in 9 districts covering a total of 13 facilities including
the National Referral Hospital, the two Regional Referral Hospitals, four district hospitals and six
basic health units (three grade I and three grade II BHUs).
The study was designed and implemented by an external consultant with the active participation
of MOH officials1, especially in the process of collecting data. The process of determining unit
costs has required the collection of a huge mass of data necessary for relating costs to activities.
In the process of collecting these data a substantial amount of work has been carried out by cen-
tral MOH staff, staff at the health facilities and district administrations including District Health
Officers and huge thanks goes out to them for active participation in the process of facilitating
this study. Time and space prevents a thorough and detailed analysis of all data collected but the
information will be provided to enable MOH officials to undertake further analysis.
It is important to note that the study has not been designed to assess the quality of the health
care services or the outcome of the care provided. It has its focus on quantification in terms of
cost of various health services at various levels of service delivery.
1The main consultant was Kim Gustavsen (Health Economist and Health Systems Specialist) and central MOH staff
included Sangay Wangmo, Tandin Dendup, Sonam Yangchen, Sonam Phuntsho and Ugyen Wangchuk.

3. OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED RESULTS OF THE STUDY
The objectives of the study were to cost the delivery of health services at different levels in Bhu-
tan in order to:
• Inform MOH of the cost of delivering various types of services at different levels;
• Increase cost-awareness and knowledge;
• Inform the policy process and input to decision making
The study also analyzes, where feasible, the cost efficiency and cost effectiveness of the services
provided by the Government of Bhutan.
The following areas were costed:
Total cost of each facility
• By category
Recurrent costs (salaries, drugs, medical equipment, utilities, maintenance, etc.)
o
Capital costs (buildings, equipment, vehicles) as yearly depreciation
o
• By type (fixed vs. variable)
• By cost center (direct and indirect costs)
Unit costs by facility
• Unit cost per OPD attendance
• Unit cost per IPD bed day
• Unit cost per IPD admission
• Unit cost per IPD by disease groupings (medical/surgical and major disease groupings)

4. THE BHUTANESE HEALTH SECTOR
In the past 20 years Bhutan has moved from a country with some of the poorest health indicators
in the world to a country that is well on its way to attaining most of the Millennium Develop-
ment Goals (MDGs). Bhutan was an early adopter of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach.
The result today is a strong and equitably distributed PHC system, with about 90% of the total
population within three hours walking distance from a service delivery unit (Health Sector Re-
view 2007).
The joint review of the health sector conducted in 2009 confirmed that the Royal Government of
Bhutan had sustained its focus on PHC and on an equitable expansion in both access to and use
of basic health services. It also noted that there were rising public expectations, increasing costs
of health services, and that human resources continued to be a critical issue.
4.1 Delivery of health care
Health care in Bhutan is delivered through a network of fairly standardized health facilities. In
2008 the District Health Service Programme was established as a part of the decentralization
reform of the 10th Five Year Plan to oversee district planning, including staffing, training, supplies
and construction. However, human resource planning and employment, as well as purchase of
drugs and equipment are still handled centrally. Likewise is construction of larger hospitals.
Vertical health and disease control programmes, including those for tuberculosis, leprosy, ma-
laria, immunizations, and maternal and child health is being managed centrally.
Table 4.1 below outlines the major developments in health facilities and staff in Bhutan in the
past 10 years.

The period has seen an increase in 65 percent of doctors and more than a doubling in the num-
ber of health assistants. The number of nurses has remained relatively stable as has the number
of health facilities with only minor increases in the numbers.

4.2 Financing of health care
The health system in Bhutan is predominantly financed by the government. A recently com-
pleted National Health Accounts study – the first of its kind in Bhutan – gives an overview of the
flow of funds in the health sector in Bhutan.
According to the results of the study the total expenditure on health in Bhutan in the financial
year 2009/10 was BTN 1,981 million or BTN 2,847 per capita (about USD 58). This amounts to 3.7
percent of GDP being on the lower side compared to other countries in the region.
The public expenditure on health as a share of total government expenditure is 6.3 percent. Only
about 11 percent of total health expenditure is household out-of-pocket expenditure.
4.3 Major health care indicators
Some of the major health indicators and development in these can be seen in table 4.2 below.
The positive trends can be attributed to the expansion of health services in the period providing
better access for the entire population as well as improvements in quality of services.

Improvements in water and sanitation, expansion of primary education and general socio-eco-
nomic development has likewise been major factors contributing to the fact that Bhutan is well
on its way to – and already has reached some – of the MDG targets. It should be noted that due
to the low population and low number of deaths maternal mortality rates should be interpreted
with caution. The MMR actually covers very few actual maternal deaths because and are in real-
ity meaningless to report in a Bhutanese context as also pointed out in the 2007 review of the
sector and again in the Joint Sector Review of 2009.
During the period a decline in the infectious diseases (diarrhea, dysentery, etc.) has been ob-
served as well as an increase in non-communicable diseases (especially diabetes and hyperten-
sion). Likewise the areas of alcohol-induced liver diseases and traffic accidents contribute to a
substantial part of the disease burden in Bhutan.

5. METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the costing methodology used for the study. A more detailed description of
the costing methodology can be found in annex B.
Scope
5Th.1e unit cost study was designed to relate activities carried out in a number of health facilities
to the costs of undertaking those activities. Data limitations and the time available for the study
limited the number of unit costs to be derived from the data. It is important to note that the
study was not designed to assess the quality of the care or the outcome of care provided and
so no judgment can be made on the relative cost-benefit of care provided by different facilities.
Likewise the unit costs represent the average cost for each facility. No marginal costing was done.
Sample size
A total of 13 facilities plus their attached out-reach clinics was covered in nine different districts.
They are represented in the table below.
Table 5.1: Health facilities studied
Facility Name Facility Type Dzongkhag/District
JDWNRH National Referral Hospital Thimphu
Mongar RRH Regional Referral Hospital Mongar
Gelephu RRH Regional Referral Hospital Sarpang
Paro DH District Hospital Paro
Wangdi Choling DH District Hospital Bumthang
Damphu DH District Hospital Tsirang
Punakha DH District Hospital Punakha
Gyelposhing BHU I Basic Health Unit, Grade I Mongar

Bali BHU I Basic Health Unit, Grade I Haa
Genekha BHU II Basic Health Unit, Grade II Thimphu
Mendelgang BHU II Basic Health Unit, Grade II Tsirang
Thinleygang BHU II Basic Health Unit, Grade II Punakha
Although only 13 facilities (plus attached out-reach clinics) of a total of 213 facilities were stud-
ied, if viewed from a service delivery point about 60 and 57 percent of respectively total OPD and
IPD cases in Bhutan was covered through the facilities included in the study. Hence coverage in
terms of services delivered was very high. This is due to the fact that all the referral hospitals as
well as some of the larger district hospitals are covered by the study.

Table 5.2 below summarizes characteristics of the 13 facilities in terms of staffing, type and num-
ber of services delivered.

Thinleygang BHU II 4 7,119 NA 1,780 NA
Total 1,523.5 623,536 27,704 409 18.3
It should be noted that the productivity results of the table above does not distinguish between
division of staff between inpatient and outpatient services. The numbers have been derived by
simple division of OPD-visits/Admissions with the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) staff
of each facility. Hence interpretations should be made with caution. For example in hospitals it
might only be half or less of the total staff that works in the OPD with the major part being in IPD.
In BHUs almost all staff works in OPD because of the (relatively) low number of inpatients. Hence
the productivity numbers of hospitals in reality would be higher than reflected in the table.
Capital Costs
Both capital and recurrent costs was considered in the study. A unit cost analysis that ignores
capital costs is assuming that physical assets will be available forever. The daily use of these
assets (buildings, equipment, etc.) and the depreciation of capital items is an expense – even
though it is not an expenditure (e.g. salaries and drugs are an expenditure).The cost of capital
items was annualized in to a yearly depreciation cost.

Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
Perspective
The perspective adopted for the study is the viewpoint of the facility – not from a society or pa-
tient perspective. The costs are thus the costs related to providing services at a given facility. This
ensures comparability and uniformity of the results as well as providing institutional information
as input to the policy process.
Hence costs incurred by patients (travel, cost of an escort, etc.) have not been considered. Like-
wise supervisory costs of central MOH and various vertical programmes have not been esti-
mated and used as overheads for the individual health facilities. Finally costing of out-of-country
referrals is not covered by the study as it is limited to the costs of health facilities in Bhutan.
Timing
The timing of the study is outlined below. The study was originally foreseen to be finalized by July
2011 but data collection took longer than expected and the nature and quality of the data also
caused delays in the data processing and thus the final report.
April: Startup – situation analysis, facility visits and setup of data collection. Consultants
first visit.
May - July: Data collection by Ministry of Health
June: Further data collection, facility visits and interviews. Consultants second visit.
July - September: Data processing and report writing
5.2 Preparation
The consultant worked closely with officers from the Policy & Planning Division of the Ministry
of Health. The initial visit in April 2011 was used to survey facilities, identify and evaluate data
sources and set up data collection. The main facility level data collection was carried out by MOH
officials in May – June 2011 following guidelines developed during the first visit of the consultant.
Sample of facilities
All the three major referral hospitals in the country were included in the study. Likewise four
district hospitals and six basic health units (three grade I and three grade II) were included. Out-
reach clinics under the respective facilities were also costed. However, the HMIS data collected
did not distinguish between services provided at the facility and services provided as a part of
the out-reach services. Hence the cost of out-reach services was included in the total cost of the
facilities and thus included in the unit costs of the entire facility.
The facilities to be included in the study were decided by the MOH. The selection of district
hospitals and basic health units was not done randomly. Geographic factors and logistics played
a role in the selection with travel distance being one of the key determinants. The limited time
14 15
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
available for the study made it necessary to minimize time spent travelling. Hence there is an
overrepresentation of facilities from the western part of the country.
Data collection guidelines
Data sources were reviewed during the inception visit in April 2011 and guidelines for data col-
lection were developed.
Definition of final product
The final product was defined initially during the inception visit and further revised and devel-
oped during the consultant’s second visit in June. The developed standard costing model was
designed in accordance with the desired output. Initially it was the ambition to include costing
of deliveries, unit costs of ANC visits as well as cost of immunization and family planning services.
However, further analysis of performed interviews and collected data made it clear that costing
of these would require further in-depth studies.
5.3 Data collection
The study required the collection of huge amounts of data from all levels as well as interviews
with key staff at facilities and central agencies. The data section in the methodology annex de-
scribes this process and the data sources in further depth.
In general a lot of data is available in Bhutan. All facilities are fully financed by the government.
Drugs, consumables and equipment are supplied from the MOH and detailed records were in
principle available. The Infrastructure Department of the MOH has data and information related
to construction of facilities. The Bhutanese Health Management Information System is generally
well developed and a lot of data is being reported using a system of standard forms at facilities
that are collected at district level, summarized and then send electronically to the MOH. The
referral hospitals keep their own records and these were also made available and used for the
study. Finally the facility-wise yearly financial statements was the main source for the facility-
wise recurrent costs.
Bhutan is a small country and the government is the main provider of health services. This gives
the government a unique opportunity for full insight into all inputs to the system – from drugs,
equipment and buildings to personnel; as well as outputs of the system in terms of services de-
livered. This opportunity is currently not being fully utilized.
The collection and processing of data revealed shortcomings that Bhutan could benefit from
improving. Some of the major ones were:
• The DVED supplied huge amounts of data and worked with high effort to satisfy the needs
for the study. However, the data received was incomplete with some areas clearly missing
– even after revisions. The major ones being purchase prices of all equipment could not
be produced; records of facility drug consumption were not available; the supplied drug
list seems to have drugs missing in the list and equipment lists of facilities unclear. A new
16 17
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
system to record and manage the information was currently being implemented and it
looked promising. Hopefully this can improve the situation.
• The BHMIS is not consistent and duplication is present with same data being reported by
different forms - and the results do not match. An example is number of admissions being
reported in one form. In another form inpatients by disease – a disaggregation of admis-
sions by disease – is reported. The two numbers do not match. And for the three referral
hospitals, that have their own records department, a third and different number from the
other two can be found.
• Disease coding is not uniform. A grouping of about 80 codes is being used in most facilities
with JDWNRH using a more elaborate version. Likewise coding is inconsistent from facil-
ity to facility. For example in the BHMIS form where inpatients are recorded by disease,
facilities record a normal delivery differently and some not at all as it is not perceived as
a disease. The ICD10 codes and structure of the BHMIS morbidity reports is in need of a
review.
• JDWNRH has the most elaborate inpatient medical records system with detailed coding
of diagnosis, patient data, bed-days etc. However, outpatient reports by disease are not
available as is the case for all other facilities in the country.
The collection of data was more complex than initially assumed. This resulted in most of the time
of the consultant’s second visit in June was spent collecting and validating data.
5.4 Standard costing model
A standard costing model was developed and used for all 13 facilities. The model is described
in detail in the methodology annex and is supplied in soft-copy together with this report. It can
thus be used to cost other health facilities in Bhutan as well as being used as a basis for further
development of costing in Bhutan. It has been designed in excel with all computations being
done automatically based on input of data to the model.
The model has a number of cost centers identified at three levels: overhead, intermediate and
final cost centers. Overhead costs being administration, security, etc; intermediate covers vari-
ous supportive functions like diagnostic services, operating theatre and kitchen. The final cost
centers include areas of final service provision like outpatient and inpatient departments.
Inputs to each cost center were identified, quantified and given a financial value. To allocate the
cost of the overhead and intermediate cost centers to final cost centers a step-wise approach
was used. Finally unit costs for final cost centers were calculated.
All data in the model is based on collected data from the various sources. In general all estima-
tions are based on facts from data, and it was rare to find completely missing data that required
full estimations of the cost items. However, as mentioned above there were issues with the
quality of data – especially in areas where different options for the same number was available.
Likewise there were areas where data was clearly missing or obviously too low – and some too
16 17

high. So some assumptions were made along the way – for example no data on equipments in
grade II basic health units were available. The methodology annex highlights all these areas.
Defining cost centers
The standard model builds on classic top-down costing methodology where cost centers are
identified and given a financial value.
The number of cost centers was defined according to the desired output of the study. In general
these are grouped in three categories – overhead, intermediate and final cost centers.
The different cost centers are depicted in the table below.

Overhead Intermediate Final
Administration Imaging Outpatient department
Transport Kitchen Inpatient department
Staff quarters Laboratory • Medical
Security & Maintenance Pharmacy/Dispensary • Surgical & medical
Operating Theatre Maternal & Child Health
Indigenous Unit
The inpatient department was divided into medical and medical & surgical wards. Based on the
disease groupings patients could be classified as either of these. Since it is not possible with cer-
tainty by disease grouping to know whether surgical or medical (or both) procedures was used in
the treatment, the group surgical & medical covers diseases where both procedures can be used
and medical only covers diseases where treatment is purely medical and not surgical.
Obviously not all facilities have all cost centers. Likewise the more advanced facilities could ben-
efit from a more detailed division of cost centers. A uniform model was selected taking time al-
located for the study, simplicity and methodological rigorousness in to consideration.
The cost of the overhead and intermediate cost centers were then allocated to the final – service
delivery – cost centers using a step-down allocation. The various keys used for these allocation
varies and can be found in details in the methodology annex. When all costs had been allocated
to final costs centers unit costs were calculated simply by dividing total cost of the cost center
with the number of units produced.
Period covered
The period chosen for the study is at the time of the study the most recent financial year 2009/10.
A period of one year was chosen in order to equalize seasonal variations as well as some key data
is only available on an annual basis like the final financial statements of the facilities.

Annual depreciation of capital items
The annual depreciation cost of capital items may be quite hard to measure if certain informa-
tion is not available like purchase price and life expectancy of items. It may therefore be very
sensitive to the assumptions made. For the purpose of the study all capital items was given a
financial value and a life expectancy. The yearly depreciation cost of capital items was then calcu-
lated using a depreciation rate of six percent based on developments in the Bhutanese consumer
price-index.
The level of detail behind the calculations of the annual depreciation of capital items is very high.
More than 1,300 types of different equipment have had life expectancy estimated in order to
calculate the annual depreciation cost. See the methodology annex for further details on how
annual depreciation of capital items was calculated.

In general fixed costs do not vary with activity (to a certain point). The buildings, number of beds and staff in
a facility are there regardless of (short‐term) variations in activity. In the longer run number of staff can be
adapted to activity but in the shorter run it is fixed.
Not surprisingly share of fixed costs are relatively high. Since only variable cost varies with activity the
marginal cost of treating one more patient is relatively low up to a certain point where it will be necessary to
expand the staff and capital items as well. Hence it can be very cost‐effective to fully utilize the fixed assets
and in the longer run adapt it to the expected demand for services.

Direct cost represents costs that can be attributed directly to the final service provision at for example
inpatient and outpatient departments. Indirect costs are from overhead and supportive services that are
allocated to final service producing departments according to various allocation keys.
22 23
The relative share of direct vs. indirect costs can give indications of the precision of the costing. As a rule of
thumb, the higher the share of direct costs, the higher the precision in the costing since fewer assumptions
on how to allocate costs has to be made. Indirect cost is from the overhead and intermediate cost centers
and the direct cost is from final cost centers in the costing model.
The direct costs of JDWNRH are relatively low standing at only 30 percent. This is mainly due to the high cost
share of drugs and medical supplies (almost one‐third of total costs) that cannot be linked directly to the
final cost centers.
6.1.4. Unit Costs
Unit costs are presented in table 6.6 below. Across the three hospitals the average unit costs of an OPD‐visit
have huge variations. The average cost of an OPD‐visit at Mongar RRH is more than six times that of Gelephu
RRH (BTN 2,683 and 439 respectively). The cost at JDWNRH is about one‐third higher than at Gelephu
standing at BTN 597. When looking at the activity Mongar RRH has a very low number of OPD‐visits of about
13,000 compared to the 61,350 and 383,658 at Gelephu RRH and JDWNRH respectively. This is the main
explanation as to why the unit cost for an OPD‐visit is so high. As noted above this could be a mistake in the
HMIS reporting. However, the number was double‐checked with Mongar RRH and confirmed.

services that are allocated to final service producing departments according to various allocation
keys.
The relative share of direct vs. indirect costs can give indications of the precision of the costing.
As a rule of thumb, the higher the share of direct costs, the higher the precision in the costing
since fewer assumptions on how to allocate costs has to be made. Indirect cost is from the over-
head and intermediate cost centers and the direct cost is from final cost centers in the costing
model.
The direct costs of JDWNRH are relatively low standing at only 30 percent. This is mainly due to
the high cost share of drugs and medical supplies (almost one-third of total costs) that cannot be
linked directly to the final cost centers.
6.1.4. Unit Costs
Unit costs are presented in table 6.6 below. Across the three hospitals the average unit costs of
an OPD-visit have huge variations. The average cost of an OPD-visit at Mongar RRH is more than
six times that of Gelephu RRH (BTN 2,683 and 439 respectively). The cost at JDWNRH is about
one-third higher than at Gelephu standing at BTN 597. When looking at the activity Mongar RRH
has a very low number of OPD-visits of about 13,000 compared to the 61,350 and 383,658 at
Gelephu RRH and JDWNRH respectively. This is the main explanation as to why the unit cost for
an OPD-visit is so high. As noted above this could be a mistake in the HMIS reporting. However,
the number was double-checked with Mongar RRH and confirmed.
The average cost of an inpatient admission has less variation with the lowest being BTN 12,907
at Gelephu RRH and BTN 17,848 and 19,974 at JDWNRH and Mongar RRH respectively. The aver-
age cost per bed-day is BTN 2,465, 2,810 and 2,996 for Gelephu RRH, JDWNRH and Mongar RRH
respectively. In line with average cost per admission Mongar RRH is the most expensive hospital
due to its low utilization relative to costs. Likewise Mongar RRH has the highest average length of
stay of 6.7 days per admission (24,051/3,608) compared to 6.4 and 5.2 for JDWNRH and Gelephu
RRH respectively.

As is generally noted the high‐levels of fixed costs will – to a certain point – mean low marginal costs. The
difficult exercise is how to adapt the demand to the optimal level of activity where fixed assets are fully
utilized.
6.2.3. Direct and Indirect Costs
In table 6.11 below direct vs. indirect costs of the four district hospitals are presented. The share of direct
costs varies from 34 percent at Damphu Hospital to more than 60 percent at Paro Hospital.
Direct cost represents costs that can be attributed directly to the final service provision at for example
inpatient and outpatient departments. Indirect costs are from overhead and supportive services that are
allocated to final service producing departments according to various allocation keys.

Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
Direct cost represents costs that can be attributed directly to the final service provision at for
example inpatient and outpatient departments. Indirect costs are from overhead and supportive
services that are allocated to final service producing departments according to various allocation
keys.
As such the share direct costs can give indications of the precision of the costing. As a rule of
thumb, the higher the share of direct costs, the higher the precision in the costing since fewer
assumptions on how to allocate costs has to be made. Indirect cost is from the overhead and
intermediate cost centers and the direct cost is from final cost centers in the costing model.
Five of six BHUs have direct cost shares above 50 percent. It is only in Gyelposhing it is very low
(29.8 percent). The explanation to this can be found by analyzing the cost center data of Gyel-
poshing further. Here it becomes evident that cost of laboratory services is very high, suggesting
some kind of research taking place.
6.3.4. Unit Costs
Unit costs are presented in tables 6.24 and 6.25 below. Across the six basic health units the aver-
age unit cost of an OPD-visit varies from BTN 128 to 199. Compared to some of the variations
of the district and referral hospitals these results are much more in line with each other with no

Inpatient data is only reported for BHU Is. There are also inpatients at BHU IIs but interviews with staff at the
facilities uncovered that it was very limited (30‐40 yearly) and they were all either discharged or referred to
another facility after spending one night.
The average cost of an inpatient admission at a BHU II varies from BTN 4,395 at Bajo to 18,074 at
Gyelposhing with Bali in between at BTN 7,354. The very high cost at Gyelposhing relates to the fact that
only 49 patients were there in the period studied. The same numbers for Bajo and Bali were 1,123 and 476
respectively.
As valid data on number of bed‐days is not available for the basic health units no cost has been calculated.
However, if valid data becomes available, the design of the costing model allows for it to be entered and
have the cost calculated automatically.
Across all basic health units the average cost of surgical admissions are higher than medical admissions.
In table 6.26 below the number of admissions and cost of these are grouped in to the major diagnostic
groups following the format used in the HMIS reporting for the BHU IIs. As with the district hospitals no valid
data on total bed‐days and average length of stay for the different disease groupings were available. So each
group has received a weight based on a weighted average of the average length of stay in each disease
group at the three referral hospitals. Using this weight the unit costs has been calculated.

7. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
This section analyses and sums up the main results from the previous section.
7.1. Assumptions and limitations
The design of a costing study based on a uniform model is based on a number of assumptions
and naturally has its limitations. It is important to understand and consider these when analyzing
the results. It also has strengths.
The strength of this study design is that by basing the costing on a uniform model it allows for
comparisons between facilities as all are subject to the same assumptions and limitations. Like-
wise it can easily be expanded to include other facilities of the country as well as being updated
regularly with newer data in order to analyze developments over time. The study is to a very
high degree based on data regularly registered and maintained at facilities and MOH. Only in a
few selected areas assumptions on data has been made, for example when the information was
missing. This high degree of data dependency is a strength resulting in “real” results. However, it
also makes the results very sensitive to issues with data quality as will be discussed below.
The main assumptions and limitations of the study are listed and commented below. The de-
tailed model design can be found in the annex.
• Quality not assessed. The focus of the study has been on quantification in terms of cost of
health services at various levels of service delivery. The quality of the health care services
or the outcome of care has not been assessed. This implies when making comparisons
there is an underlying assumption – ceteris paribus – that the results or quality of the
services we compare are the same.
• Uniform model design assumes uniform facilities. The uniformity of the model design
treats the facilities as uniform entities producing the same output. Even though there is
a high degree of uniformity of health facilities in Bhutan there are still differences among
facilities. These issues need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the results.
For example we know that various specialized diagnostic services are available only in
some facilities as well as case-mix of patients vary within the same diagnostic groups.
• Top-down model design. The top-down design of the model allows for giving a macro-pic-
ture of cost structures and unit costs of various facilities. However, more detailed costing
of specific services (micro-costing) would also require a bottom-up approach like Activity-
Based-Costing. There was an interest in doing this in a few selected areas like costing of
specific laboratory and diagnostic services. This can be done using an ABC-analysis ap-
proach but this kind of analysis is a whole study in itself and could not be fitted within the
time-frame of the current study. Likewise it is only a fragment of the various diagnostic
services that are reported in the BHMIS, so it would require a detailed output analysis at
selected facilities in this area as well. However, since the costing model have defined cost
centers for supportive services like laboratory and imaging the facility-wise total cost of
42 43
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
these areas is available and can be found in the more detailed data annex for all 13 facili-
ties.
• Average vs. Marginal Costing. The study analyses average cost of services. Cost structures
of fixed and variable costs imply that the marginal cost of treating for example more pa-
tients – to a certain point – is lower than the average cost – and often much lower when
looking at the relatively high share of fixed costs at the facilities. It can therefore not be
concluded that “moving” production around between facilities from expensive to cheaper
facilities would result in reducing the costs by the differences in average costs of the facili-
ties. This could to some degree be the case in the longer run if the fixed costs are adapted
to meet new levels of service delivery.
• Data issues. In general the study is very data intensive and thus the results are very sensi-
tive to the quality of data. This is dealt with separately in the section below.
7.2. Data issues
The costing study is very data intensive. All results are based on data from facilities, MOH and
district authorities and thus sensitive to the quality of data. During the course of collecting, pro-
cessing and analyzing the data various issues became apparent. These are summarized below.
General issues
• Data availability. In theory all the needed data for the study was available from various
institutions and facilities. This is very unique especially for a country at the developing
stage of Bhutan. This is possible due to the purely public health system of Bhutan as well
as centralization of key function like health infrastructure management, procurement and
supply of drugs and medical equipment and a national health information system. The
only information that was collected was information like deployment of staff at differ-
ent departments of the facilities in order to design the various allocation mechanisms of
the costing model. This was collected by interviewing key staff-members and fill in pre-
defined forms. This gives a unique opportunity to do a lot of quantitative based analysis
beyond doing a cost analysis. However, even though the data was available the form it
was available in as well as the quality of the data was very fluctuating. The review and
analysis conducted during this study especially uncovered two areas that would benefit
greatly from renewed focus and improvements. These were the Bhutanese Health Man-
agement and Information System (BHMIS) and the data management of equipments and
drugs at the Drugs, Vaccines and Equipment Division (DVED) of the MOH.
Input data
• Financial information. Financial statements from the financial year 2009/10 were easily
available. Information is collected by line items and in general does not support managers
in making informed decisions on resource use. There is generally no system in place to
compute costs, productivity or efficiency indicators to support rational use of resources.
42 43
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
• Drugs and consumables. Lists of actual use of drugs and consumables were not avail-
able making tracking of it difficult. Instead was used facility-wise drugs and consumables
distributed in the financial year 2009/10. It is thus assumed that what is delivered will be
consumed. For some types this might be the case whereas for others definitely not. There
is one exception – JDWNRH. Here the medical consumables were actual consumption in
the financial year. Likewise it was difficult to actually obtain valid purchase prices. It is the
general feeling of the consultant that the lists supplied of drugs and consumables were
incomplete and in areas incorrect with regards to unit prices of various commodities. This
is supported by the relatively high amount medical supplies of JDWNRH that is based on
actual consumption.
• Medical equipment. Lists of medical equipment of the various facilities were not available
from the DVED. Instead the annual indents were used in conjunction with a recent equip-
ment inventory collected from selected facilities by another department of the MOH. Pur-
chase prices were supplied from DVED and where not available it was estimated. It is the
general feeling of the consultant that the equipment lists are incomplete and thus to a
certain degree underestimates the annual depreciation cost of equipment.
Output data
The main output data source is the Bhutan Health Management Information System (BHMIS). In
addition to this inpatient records from the three referral hospitals were used as well as outpa-
tient records from JDWNRH. Likewise selected interviews with staff at the facilities were used to
qualify the reported activity of the facilities.
• BHMIS reporting forms. There are many forms used by the facilities to report to the BHMIS
and some forms duplicate the reported activity. For example one form is used to report
total admissions and another to report admissions by morbidity. Having too many forms
results in unnecessary bureaucracy, increased administrative burdens and increased risk
of reporting mistakes. The reporting likewise did not allow for disaggregation of activities
taking place as out-reach services.
• Irregularities in reported activity. The above duplication leads to different results for the
same activity depending on where in the BHMIS you search for the information. Likewise
reporting irregularities was observed and staff was not sure on what to actually report
in some of the forms. For example at some facilities a normal delivery was reported in
the morbidity inpatient report and in others it wasn’t. Likewise where deliveries were
reported the disease coding varied as no code for a normal delivery is being used in the
morbidity reporting.
• No uniform disease coding. The ICD10 system is used for disease coding. In the BHMIS is
reported on a total of about 80 codes (or group of codes). However, the morbidity reports
only include “diseases” leaving no obvious place to record activities like deliveries unless
they experience complications. Likewise JDWNRH uses more detailed level of ICD10 cod-
ing that expands on the 80 codes.
44 45
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
• No uniform electronic patient administrative system. The larger hospitals have their own
electronic patient administrative system to record activities in. However, the systems vary
from typing into Word to using spreadsheets and databases (Excel and Access). The sec-
tor could benefit greatly from a uniform system to be implemented at all hospitals that
could also track drug use by patients. By having this, the HMIS reporting could be based on
simple data queries to the system and abandoning the manual reporting by filling in forms
or typing into a web-based user-interface.
• Only selected diagnostic services covered by BHMIS. Only a small selection of the most
common diagnostic services is reported in the BHMIS system for laboratory and imaging.
It was initially the ambition of the study to include costing of services like deliveries, immuniza-
tions and various laboratory services. However, further investigations – as mentioned above
– revealed that the available data did not support unit costing of these areas. Further analysis
outside the scope of this study would be necessary. However, as both imaging and laboratory
services are quantified as cost centers, the total cost of these services are available for each facil-

ity – just no unit costing of services (see annex D).

Table 7.1 above presents the composition of costs at three levels: Referral hospitals, district hospitals and
basic health units.
Recurrent costs account for the main part of the costs at all types of facilities with salaries being the major
cost item. The share of recurrent costs is highest at BHUs (81 percent) and lowest at district hospitals (57
percent). Likewise district hospitals have the highest share of cost on buildings with the annual depreciation

cost of these amounting to one‐third of the total yearly cost.
The highest cost share of drugs, medical supplies and equipment can be found at referral hospitals and then
district hospitals with BHUs having the lowest share. This reflects the more advanced services provided at
referral hospitals and district hospitals that requires more intensive drugs, supplies and equipment.
7.4. Cost efficiency and cost effectiveness
Cost efficiency
Providing services in a cost efficient way means optimizing the output given the input or minimizing the
input to a given output – or put in another way getting most value for money.
It can be difficult to measure as there is – as also mentioned above ‐ generally no system in place to compute
costs, productivity or efficiency indicators to support rational use of resources. The difficulties of tracking
drugs and consumables to patients inhibit cost efficiency improvements.
Likewise the cost variations seen at facilities are related both to the way services are delivered as well as the
demand for services that affect costs. Further analysis is needed to distinguish one from the other.

efforts in this regard would benefit from being supported.
With availability of this information and further adaption of production inputs to actual demand
for services cost efficiency can be improved.

Where cost-efficiency is about optimizing the production/delivery of services at a health facility,
cost-effectiveness is about choosing the correct and cost-effective options. For example where is
it most cost-effective to supply the services?

If we assume that just ten percent of the patients at referral hospitals could receive services at
district hospitals and again that ten percent of patie3n9t s at district hospitals could receive services
at BHUs this means that for just the 13 facilities included in the study about BTN 32,000,000
could be saved on a yearly basis in the long run. That is roughly the cost of running 15 BHUs in
one year.
This is of course a simplified calculation and is in general under the assumption that the capital
items in the long run will adapt to the demand in order make changes in the fixed costs and not
only variable costs. However, even taking the simplicity in mind the study supports the fact that
cost savings can be made by increasing cost efficiency and cost effectiveness of delivered ser-
vices and channel the patients to the right facilities.

7.5 Productivity
A key factor that affects unit costs at all facilities is the productivity of staff. In table 7.3 below
some overall productivity indicators of the 13 facilities can be seen. The numbers are a bit rough
but give an indication of the variations among facilities.

Note: Various sources used as outlined in the methodology section.
It should be noted that the productivity numbers are based on total staff. That means for ex-
ample that OPD-visits per full-time-equivalent staff include all staff of the facility and not only
the staff working in the OPD-department. So for example BHU IIs will score higher on OPD-visits
since they have no or very limited IPD-services.
In general the higher the number the more productive is the facility. For example Wangdo Chol-
ing Hospital has a very high OPD-productivity and is also the district hospital with the lowest unit
cost per OPD-visit.
The variations in the numbers indicate that there are areas where the staffing could be more
aligned with the actual activity taking place at the facility. Low numbers is an indication of cost
inefficiency.
The results reflected in table 7.3 emphasizes that assignment of personnel to the facilities is not
optimally linked to outputs or productivity. More optimal and cost efficient options for assigning
personnel are available and should be further investigated.

8. Concluding remarks and recommendations
The objectives of the study were to cost the delivery of health services at different levels in Bhu-
tan in order to:
• Inform MOH of the cost of delivering various types of services at different levels;
• Increase cost-awareness and knowledge;
• Inform the policy process and input to decision making
Analysis, where feasible, of the cost efficiency and cost effectiveness of the services provided by
the Government of Bhutan.
Main results and observations
The results as reflected in the report meet the above objectives and some of the main observa-
tions are summarized below:
• Costs and cost-structures at facilities. The study gives a detailed insight into total costs,
cost-structures and composition of costs of facilities at various levels.
• Unit costs. The costs of OPD-visits, admissions in general as well as disease-specific group-
ings of admissions have been calculated and shows – as would be expected – that services
are generally more costly at higher levels. An OPD-visit is generally four times as costly at
a referral hospital compared to a BHU and twice as costly compared to a district hospital.
Inpatients unit costs show the same pattern. The average inpatient cost of a referral hospital
is about three times that of a BHU and more than one-half time that of a district hospital.
• Cost-effectiveness. Providing services at the lowest effective level of service delivery (facili-
ties) is the most cost-effective way of providing services in the long run. It is a challenge to
control demand for services and channel the patients to the right facilities. If this is man-
aged, it will in the longer run result in cost savings.
• Cost-efficiency. More optimal and cost efficient options for assigning personnel to facilities
are available and if pursued could result in both cost cutting and reductions in waiting times
for patients.
• Data issues. In general a huge amount of health related data is available in Bhutan. The
costing study reviewed a lot of these sources extensively and the review and analysis con-
ducted as a part of the study especially uncovered two areas that would benefit greatly
from renewed focus and improvements. These were the Bhutanese Health Management
and Information System (BHMIS) and the data management of equipments and drugs at the
Drugs, Vaccines and Equipment Division (DVED) of the MOH.

Way forward – and recommendations
This study is the first comprehensive attempt to do costing analysis in Bhutan. As such it should
be seen as a starting point for further analysis in specific areas like for example costing of diag-
nostic services.
The methodology has been described in detail and the standard costing model can be used to
include other facilities, update costing data in order to follow yearly developments in cost of
services. The methodology can be further developed and fine-tuned. Data and data sources used
in the costing exercise – as well as other areas – can undergo improvements in order to increase
both precision of the costing as well as general quality of the information. Information that can
be used together with the results of the costing exercise to assist decision makers in making
informed decisions.
The results can be used as input in the design of new policies. Should the current political discus-
sions regarding charging non-Bhutanese for health services materialize the results of the unit
costing can be used to set tariffs.
In addition to the above mentioned areas/options for using the results, there are especially two
other areas where the analysis done in the study points towards efficiency gains and cost cut-
ting. These are firstly a revision – or development - of the referral system and secondly further
analysis of productivity at the facilities.
It is therefore recommended to:
• Analyze options for developing and implementing a referral system for elective services
in Bhutan that embraces cost-effective provision of services by channeling the patients
to facilities with the lowest level of effective service delivery. – If the service needed by a
patient is provided at a district hospital the patient should in principle not receive it at a
referral hospital.
• Further analyze productivity – especially in terms of allocated personnel – in order to
more effectively align staff allocations with actual output of the facilities. This will both
ensure a more cost efficient use of resources as well as reducing waiting times in “over-
populated” facilities.

ANNEX A: METHODOLOGY
This study used an easily replicable methodology to assess the cost of resources used to provide
services at health facilities in Bhutan.
Scope
The unit cost study was designed to relate activities carried out in a number of health facilities
to the costs of undertaking those activities. Data limitations and the time available for the study
limited the number of unit costs to be derived from the data. It is important to note that the
study was not designed to assess the quality of the care or the outcome of care provided and
so no judgment can be made on the relative cost-benefit of care provided by different facilities.
Likewise the unit costs represent the average cost for each facility. No marginal costing was done.
Sample size
A total of 13 facilities plus their attached out-reach clinics was covered in nine different districts.
They are represented in the table below.
Although only 13 facilities (plus attached out-reach clinics) of a total of 213 facilities was studied,
if viewed from a service delivery point about 60 and 57 percent of respectively total OPD and IPD
cases in Bhutan was covered. Hence coverage in terms of services delivered was very high. This
is due to the fact that all the referral hospitals as well as some of the larger district hospitals are
covered by the study.

Perspective
The perspective adopted for the study is the viewpoint of the facility – not from a society or pa-
tient perspective. The costs are thus the costs related to providing services at a given facility. This
ensures comparability and uniformity of the results as well as providing institutional information
as input to the policy process.
Hence costs incurred by patients (travel, cost of an escort, etc.) have not been considered. Like-
wise costs of central MOH and various vertical programmes have not been estimated and used
as overheads for the individual health facilities. Finally costing of out-of-country referrals is not
covered by the study.
Timing
The timing of the study is outlined below. The study was originally foreseen to be finalized by July
2011 but data collection took longer than expected and the nature and quality of the data also
caused delays in the data processing and thus the final report.
April: Startup – situation analysis, facility visits and setup of data collection. Consultants first visit
and inception report.
May - July: Data collection by Ministry of Health
June: Further data collection, facility visits and interviews. Consultants second visit.
July - September: Data processing and report writing
Preparation
The consultant worked closely with officers from the Policy & Planning Department of the Min-
istry of Health. The initial visit in April 2011 was used to survey facilities, identify and evaluate
data sources and set up data collection. The main decentral (facility) data collection was carried
out by MOH officials in May and June 2011 following guidelines developed during the first visit
of the consultant.
Sample of facilities
The three major referral hospitals were all included in the study. Likewise were four district hos-
pitals and six basic health units (three grade I and three grade II). Out-reach clinics under the re-
spective facilities was also costed. However, the HMIS data collected did not distinguish between
services provided at the facility and services provided as a part of the out-reach services. Hence
the cost of out-reach services was included in the total cost of the facilities and thus included in
the unit costs of the entire facility.
The facilities to be included in the study were decided by the MOH. The selection of district hos-
pitals and basic health units was not done randomly. Geography and logistics played a role in the
selection with travel distance being one of the key determinants. The limited time available for
the study made it necessary to minimize time spent travelling. Hence there is an overrepresenta-
tion of facilities from the western part of the country.

Data collection guidelines
Data sources were reviewed during the inception visit in April 2011 and guidelines for data col-
lection were developed. The can be seen in the Inception Report in annex C.
Definition of final product
The final product was defined initially during the inception visit and further revised and devel-
oped during the consultant’s second visit in June. The developed standard costing model was
designed in accordance with the desired output. Initially it was the ambition to include costing
of deliveries, unit costs of ANC visits as well as cost of immunization and family planning services.
However, further analysis of performed interviews and collected data made it clear that costing
of these would require further in-depth studies.
Period covered
The period chosen for the study is at the time of the study the most recent financial year 2009/10.
A period of one year was chosen in order to equalize seasonal variations as well as some key data
is only available on an annual basis like the final financial statements of the facilities.
Data collection
The study required the collection of huge amounts of data from all levels as well as interviews
with key staff at facilities and central agencies.
In general a lot of data is available in Bhutan. All facilities are fully financed by the government.
Drugs, consumables and equipment are supplied from the MOH and detailed records were in
principle available. The Infrastructure Department of the MOH has data and information related
to construction of facilities. The Bhutanese Health Management Information System is well de-
veloped and a lot of data is being reported using a system of standard forms at facilities that are
collected at district level, summarized and then send electronically to the MOH. The referral hos-
pitals keep their own records and these were also made available and used for the study. Finally
the facility-wise yearly financial statements was the main source for the facility-wise recurrent
costs. In the table below is an overview of the data collected and the sources:

Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
Bhutan is a small country and the government is the only provider of health services. This gives
the government a unique opportunity for full insight into all inputs to the system – from drugs,
equipment and buildings to personnel; as well as outputs of the system in terms of services de-
livered. This opportunity is currently not being fully utilized.
The collection and processing of data revealed shortcomings that Bhutan could benefit from
improving. Some of the major ones were:
• The DVED supplied huge amounts of data and worked with high effort to satisfy the needs
for the study. However, the data received was incomplete with some areas clearly missing
– even after revisions. The major ones being purchase prices of all equipment could not
be produced; records of facility drug consumption were not available; the supplied drug
list seems to have drugs missing in the list and equipment lists of facilities unclear. A new
system to record and manage the information was currently being implemented and it
looked promising. Hopefully this can improve the situation.
• The BHMIS is not consistent and duplication is present with same data being reported by
different forms - and the results do not match. An example is number of admissions being
reported in one form. In another form inpatients by disease – a disaggregation of admis-
sions by disease – is reported. The two numbers do not match. And for the three referral
hospitals, that has their own records department, a third and different number from the
other two can be found.
• Disease coding is not uniform. A grouping of about 80 codes is being used in most facilities
with JDWNRH using a more elaborate version. Likewise coding is inconsistent from facil-
ity to facility. For example in the BHMIS form where inpatients are recorded by disease,
facilities record a normal delivery differently and some not at all as it is not perceived as
a disease. The ICD10 codes and structure of the BHMIS morbidity reports is in need of a
review.
• JDWNRH has the most elaborate inpatient medical records system with detailed coding
of diagnosis, patient data, bed-days etc. However, outpatient reports by disease are not
available as is the case for all other facilities in the country.
STANDARD COSTING MODEL
A standard costing model was developed and used for all 13 facilities. The model is supplied in
soft-copy together with this report. It can thus used to cost other health facilities in Bhutan as
well as being used as a basis for further development of costing in Bhutan. It has been designed
in excel with all computations being done automatically based on input of data in the model.
All data in the model is based on collected data from the various sources as outlined above. In
general all estimations are based on facts from data, and it was rare to find completely missing
data that required full estimations of the cost items. However, as mentioned above there were
issues with the quality of data – especially in areas where different options for the same number
54 55
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
was available. Likewise there were areas where data was clearly missing or obviously too low
– and some too high. So some assumptions and modifications were made along the way. The
major ones are listed below:
• No equipment data available for BHU grade II’s. Based on information from grade I BHUs
an annual depreciation cost of equipment was estimated at BTN 100,000
• Disease specific admissions at BHU grade I’s and district hospitals was in general lower
than total reported admissions. The residual of the total admissions was allocated to dis-
eases using the same distribution as reported in the disease specific admissions report
• In general drugs and consumables is what were supplied to the facility in the period
2009/10. Data on actual consumption was not available except for JDWNRH (and this was
used for JDWNRH)
• Inpatient data from the referral hospitals was sorted and organized. Obvious wrong en-
tries were deleted. This included length of stay above 1000 days, entries with wrong dis-
ease codings, etc. In total about 200 admissions was deleted from JDWNRH and about 20
– 50 from the other two referral hospitals.
• Prices for equipments were difficult to obtain. In general latest price was used. This varied
from 2007 – 2011 prices. It is common to see fluctuations from year to year (both up and
down) in prices on equipment. Hence it was not deemed necessary to adjust reported
prices to 2009/10 level.
• Many of the reported equipment items and consumables were irregular. Larger hospitals
having less equipment than smaller ones are just one example. This was not regulated and
the reported numbers were used. This should be taken into consideration when interpret-
ing the results.
• The druglist even though including about 500 items seemed incomplete as some of the
essential vaccines for example were not on the list. This was not regulated and the re-
ported numbers were used. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the
results.
• Some prices on drugs seemed questionable. For example the unit cost of arthemeter &
lumefanthrine treatment for malaria is extremely high and hopefully wrong. This was not
regulated and the reported numbers were used. This should be taken into consideration
when interpreting the results.
• There seems to be a “jump” in the costing of buildings from BHU I to district hospitals
with a cost per square meter being more than double at district hospitals and above. The
sources for the costing of these are the same but reported separately.
• Some data for Thinleygang was unusable and hence some of the numbers used are esti-
mated based on the very similar facility Mendelgang.

Defining cost centers
Standard costing methodology with a top-down approach was used. A bottom-up approach was
used to assess direct cost at the various departments or “cost centers” where staff time was al-
located directly according to interviews and filling in a staff allocation form.
In accordance with the functional structure of health facilities in Bhutan and the available data a
standard model was developed. The model that is being used for all 13 facilities have a number
of cost centers identified at three levels:
• Overhead Cost Centers: Includes administration (accounting, etc.) and general services
(security, maintenance, reception, telephone operators, etc.).
• Intermediate Cost Center: Includes various supportive functions like investigative services
(radiology, laboratory, etc.), operating theatre and kitchen.
• Final Cost Centers. Includes final service provision like outpatient and inpatient depart-
ments as well as indigenous and Maternal and Child Health. No unit costing was done for
the last two areas as the quality of the activity data was not adequate and likewise further
in-depth interviews at all facilities would be needed.
Inputs to each cost center were identified, quantified and given a financial value. To allocate the
cost of the overhead and intermediate cost centers to final cost centers a step-wise approach
was used. Finally unit costs for final cost centers could be calculated. This is dealt with in further
detail in the following.
The number of cost centers was defined according to the desired output of the study. The differ-
ent cost centers are depicted in the table below.

Staff quarters Laboratory • Medical

Operating Theatre Maternal & Child Health

The inpatient department was divided into medical and medical & surgical wards. Based on the
disease groupings patients could be classified as either of these. Since it is not possible with cer-
tainty by disease grouping to know whether surgical or medical (or both) procedures was used in
the treatment, the group surgical & medical covers diseases where both procedures can be used
and medical only covers diseases where treatment is purely medical and not surgical.
56 57
Costing of Health Services in Bhutan
Obviously not all facilities have all cost centers. Likewise the more advanced facilities could ben-
efit from a more detailed division of cost centers. A uniform model was selected taking time al-
located for the study, simplicity and methodological rigorousness in to consideration.

Both capital and recurrent costs was considered in the study. A unit cost analysis that ignores
capital costs is assuming that physical assets will be available forever. The daily use of these
assets (buildings, equipment, etc.) and the depreciation of capital items is an expense – even
though it is not an expenditure (i.e. like salaries and drugs are an expenditure).
The annual depreciation cost of capital items may be quite hard to measure if certain informa-
tion is not available like purchase price and life expectancy of items. It may therefore be very
sensitive to the assumptions made. For the purpose of the study all capital items was given a
financial value and a life expectancy. The yearly depreciation cost of capital items was then cal-
culated using a depreciation rate of six percent based on developments the latest years in the
Bhutanese consumer price-index.
To calculate the yearly depreciation cost of capital items a standard method was used. If the
capital outlay is K, we need to find the annual sum E which over a period of n years (the life of
the capital item), at an interest rate r, will be equivalent to K. This is expressed by the following
formula:
This formula was used to calculate the annual depreciation cost of capital items (for more on an-
nualization of capital items see Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes
by Drummond et. al, 2005.
The level of detail behind the calculations of the annual depreciation of capital items is very
high. More than 1,300 types of different equipment have had life expectancy estimated in order
to calculate the annual depreciation cost. To do this, items was grouped in four groups of as-
sumed life expectancy: 1, 5, 10 and 15 years. Those with one year life expectancy were naturally
considered a consumable. In the literature it is generally assumed that clinical items only have a
life expectancy of 5 years (see for example: Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care
Programmes by Drummond et. al, 2005.). However, for this exercise clinical items was generally
grouped to either 5 or 10 years based on factors like price, type and general judgment of the con-
sultant. Only various stout furniture etc. was given a life expectancy of 15 years. Vehicles were
given a life expectancy of 10 years and buildings 30 years.

Calculate direct costs for each cost center
The various input data was allocated to the cost centers. Staff was allocated according to facility
filled forms of staff allocations. Many staff typically works in multiple departments. For example,
sometimes doctors or nurses work for both inpatient and outpatient departments. Staff time
and related salaries are thus allocated to relevant cost centers according to the proportion of the
time spent at that cost center.
Drugs were allocated to the pharmacy as was medical supplies that could not directly be allo-
cated to other cost centers. Cost of utilities was allocated to overhead cost centers.
Step-wise allocation of overhead and intermediate cost centers to final cost centers
Above all cost was allocated to overhead, intermediate or final cost centers. The cost allocated to
overhead and intermediate can be seen as indirect cost that in the next step has to be allocated
to the final cost centers.
The first step of this allocation is to take all overhead costs and allocate it to intermediate and fi-
nal cost centers. Then take the new intermediate cost centers and allocate these to the final cost
centers. To do this certain allocation rules were used. These are summarized and commented in
the table below.
Cost Center Allocation rule
Overhead
Administration Allocated to intermediate and final cost centers based on share of direct
cost
Transport Allocated to intermediate and final cost centers based on share of direct
cost
Staff quarters Allocated to intermediate and final cost centers based on share of direct
cost
Security & Maintenance Allocated to intermediate and final cost centers based on share of direct
cost
Intermediate
Imaging Allocated to final cost centers: OPD, IPD and MCH based on share of direct
cost
Kitchen Allocated fully to IPD and IPD medical and surgical weighted based on num-
ber of admissions of each type
Laboratory Allocated to final cost centers: OPD, IPD and MCH based on share of direct
cost
Pharmacy/Dispensary 10 percent allocated to MCH, 90 percent to IPD and OPD based on activity
giving 4 OPD-visit the same weight as 1 IPD-admission.
Operating Theatre Fully allocated to surgical IPD

Calculate unit costs
After the step-wise allocation of costs to final cost centers unit costs are easily calculated by di-
viding total cost of each final cost center with the activity of the cost center.
The calculations of unit costs for disease-specific inpatients were done using weights to each
disease-group. Bed days per disease group were used as the weight. Unique data of disease-wise
bed-days were available from the inpatient records of the three referral hospitals. This data was
not available from district hospitals and basic health units. Hence the weights used for these
were based on a weighted average of the three referral hospitals.

Issue Brief Series on:
SUSTAINABLE HEALTH FINANCING IN BHUTAN
The project was generously funded by the Government of Japan
through the Japan PHRD Fund and administered by the World Bank.
COVER PAGE
This cover page serves as an introduction to this series on sustainable health financing for Bhutan. By summarizing
recent evidence and regional trends, this series is designed to provide Bhutan’s policymakers a digestible resource
through which to better understand and respond to existing as well as emergent health financing challenges.
Bhutan – a small mountainous kingdom with a population of 0.72 million – has made important strides
towards a high-performing health financing system in recent decades. Current health expenditures have
grown impressively—from US$30 per capita in the year 2000 to above US$134 in 2020. Public spending
on health as a share of GDP is also among the highest in South Asia at 3.4%, meanwhile out-of-pocket
expenditures are among the lowest in the region and among other lower-middle income countries.
However, serious health financing challenges lie ahead. As a result of lingering scars from COVID-
19’s economic shock and other subsequent global and local factors, Bhutan now faces both worsening
macroeconomic growth prospects as well as a worsening macro-fiscal position. For example, per capita
economic growth turned negative in 2020 and 2021 and is expected to slow again in 2023-24. While rising
public debt means fiscal consolidation—i.e., reduction in public spending—by the Royal Government of
Bhutan (RGoB) is needed. The key implication is that without a change in policy, Bhutan’s per capita public
expenditures on health are likely to shrink and then stagnate in the short term. At the same time, Bhutan’s
health system costs and healthcare needs are rising—and are expected to continue rising due to rapid
population aging and an associated change in relative disease burden towards noncommunicable diseases.
The intersecting dynamics of rising healthcare costs, declining public resources, and an aging population
mean that the broader sustainability of public health spending is at risk—and a policy response is necessary.
Accordingly, the objective of this Series is to provide Bhutan’s health sector policy leaders with a common
understanding of existing as well as emergent health financing challenges, such that a reform pathway to
sustainable (and sufficient) health financing can then be charted.

ISSUE BRIEF 1
Health Financing Challenges and Opportunities Ahead
This issue brief provides an overview of Bhutan’s current macro-fiscal trajectory and summarizes the linkages
between emergent macro-fiscal challenges and sustainable health financing in the country as it recovers from
COVID-19’s “Double Shock”—health as well as economic—and other shocks to the global economy in 2022/23.
BHUTAN IS AN IMPRESSIVE HEALTH FINANCING PERFORMER IN THE REGION...
Bhutan – a small mountainous kingdom with a population of 0.72 million – has made important strides
towards a high-performing health financing system in recent decades. Current health expenditures, for
example, have quadrupled since 2000, from US$30 per capita to US$134 in 2020 (Figure 1). Public spending
on health as a share of GDP is also among the highest in South Asia (Figure 2). As a result of strong public
investment and a constitutional mandate to provide “free access to basic public health services in both
modern and traditional medicines,” the burden placed on households for financing their healthcare (i.e.,
out-of-pocket (OOP) share of current health expenditures) was just 18% in FY2020/21.2 Far lower than regional
and lower-middle income country averages (Figure 2).
Figure 1. Bhutan’s Health Expenditures3 Figure 2. Levels of Financial Protection, 20204
…BUT SERIOUS HEALTH FINANCING CHALLENEGES NOW LIE AHEAD:
Bhutan today faces a fragile short-term macroeconomic situation.5 The COVID-19 pandemic was not just a
health emergency but also a major economic shock: Bhutan’s per capita economic growth turned negative
for two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) for the first time in nearly three decades (Figure 3). Although
positive growth returned in 2022 alongside further easing of COVID-related restrictions, challenges in the
global economy mean that growth is expected to slow again in 2023-24.6 Growth in non-hydro power sectors,
including tourism, is likely to remain suppressed as large drivers of global demand (i.e., the US, China, and
the European Union) continue to experience slow economic recoveries.7 Additionally, unemployment (3.6%),
particularly youth unemployment (20.9%), is elevated. Together, these challenges have contributed to a
serious outmigration challenge.8

Figure 3. Per Capita GDP Growth in Bhutan, 1997-2028
The Royal Government of Bhutan’s (RGoB) fiscal position is vulnerable. Bhutan’s public revenues are
expected to decline as a share of GDP from over 31% in 2019 (pre-COVID) to between 24% and 27% in 2023
and 2024 respectively.9 Delays in completion of hydel projects are an additional source of risk for future
revenues. Owing to high fiscal deficits in recent years, per capita government spending which has been
declining since 2021 can be expected to continue to trend negatively in the near future (Figure 4 below). In
this context, expansionary fiscal policy, including additional investments for health, are unlikely.
At the same time healthcare costs are rising—and rising faster than inflation. Total healthcare costs at
Bhutan’s referral hospitals have increased, even after prices are held constant, by 62%, and by 54% at
the district level hospitals between 2018/19 and 2009/10.10 Similarly, unit costs of healthcare services have
increased at all levels of the healthcare system, from per visit costs at primary health care centers, to per-
admissions costs at the large referral hospitals. The twin dynamics of rising healthcare costs and declining
public resources mean the sustainability of public health financing is at risk—and a policy response is
necessary “to secure the prioritization of health spending and avoid further setbacks on the path toward the
health-related SDGs.”11
Accordingly, this series of issue briefs is designed to provide policymakers with a digestible introduction
to existing as well as emergent health financing challenges. The objective of this series, therefore, is to help
Bhutan’s Ministries of Health and Finance build a shared understanding of challenges from which a reform
pathway for more sustainable (and sufficient) health financing can be charted. To achieve this objective, each
issue brief in this series provides data, recent evidence, and explanations for three core health financing
challenges facing Bhutan today: (1) sustainable financing for health considering fiscal constraints; (2) addressing
issues of efficiency in the health sector; and (3) health financing responses to rapid epidemiological and
demographic transition. The challenges taken up here are consistent with those identified in the Ministry of
Health’s 2022 Policy Brief Healthcare Financing in Bhutan (2018-2020).

CHALLENGE 1:
MAINTAINING ADEQUATE FISCAL SPACE FOR HEALTH
As Bhutan recovers from the double health and economic shock brought by the pandemic,12 the RGoB will
find it increasingly harder to grow its fiscal space for health in the next few years. The key reason is because
the RGoB will not be able to continue its reliance on conducive macroeconomic conditions to finance rising
health spending. After the RGoB’s pursuit of counter-cyclical fiscal policies13, which resulted in increased
spending on health during the first two years of the pandemic, fiscal tightening is now expected. Total annual
public expenditures are expected to decline until about 2025 (Figure 4), while the share of the public budget
spent on debt servicing is likely to rise continuously through 2028. The combined effect is that discretionary
public expenditures – i.e., those expenditures that are most relevant to understanding available fiscal space
for health – will likely not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2027. Given that Bhutan’s health sector is
almost entirely financed using public expenditures, it is important that policy makers clearly understand the
implications of fiscal tightening on near- and medium-term health financing.
Figure 4. Key macro-fiscal Indicators for Bhutan 1997-2028 (Projected)14
Declining government expenditures over the next few years impact fiscal space for health via the
mathematical relationship described in Figure 5 below. Firstly, per the IMF’s latest economic forecasts,
government expenditures as a share of GDP are expected to remain suppressed around 28%, more than
5 points lower than the 35% share seen in Bhutan in the pre-pandemic era. Lower levels of government
expenditures directly constrain fiscal space for health. Secondly, Bhutan’s GDP per capital is lower today
than it was in 2019 – and is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024-25.15 Finally, as government
expenditures fall, the share of the budget prioritized for health may become harder to maintain, as demands
from other critical sectors which may have been de-prioritized during the COVID-19 health emergency may
become more competitive.

2023 11% %34 $3,498 $132
2024 10% %30 $3,661 $116
Most importantly, the combined effect of the downward pressures on the levers of public health expenditures
is that the RGoB may not be able to sustain the same levels of public spending on health that have been
observed in the past. While the overall pressure on fiscal space may be negative in the immediate term,
policy makers nevertheless have important discretion over what happens to the status of health financing
in Bhutan: If the high priority given to health during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, where health’s share
of general government expenditures increased in Bhutan to above 10%, reverses back to earlier levels, that
were much closer to 7.5%, then per capita health expenditures may not return to levels observed during
2020/21 until five years from now.
Ultimately, in the current context, Bhutan’s policy makers must begin considering ways to protect or
grow fiscal space for health. In addition to closely monitoring and ensuring that government investment
in healthcare does not decline, supplementary resources for health may need to be explored through pro-
health taxes and by generating efficiency gains. This is a more sustainable strategy than relying on external
financing for health, which comprised around 7% of total health spending in 2019 – among the highest share
of its kind in the region. Rather, good use of monies to improve quality service delivery would not only help
fill gaps in Bhutan’s preparedness for future crises but also sustain and/or improve its population health
outcomes. The second issue brief in this series assesses fiscal space in greater detail and outlines the most
promising options available.
CHALLENGE 2:
FINANCING BHUTAN’S EPIDEMILOGICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION
The rise in share of NCDs in Bhutan’s national disease burden has been dramatic. In less than two decades
the NCD share of the national disease burden has increased from 35% to 62%.17 At the same time, the share
of the population aged 65 and older is expected to almost triple between 2020 and 2050, from 6% to 16%.18
This means the share of NCDs such a hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular conditions – i.e.,
conditions that impact wellbeing in later years of life – in the national disease burden will increase further
still. The policy response required from a service delivery perspective is to transition the care system towards
the upstream management of chronic conditions in appropriately low-cost primary care settings to prevent
unnecessary and costly acute exacerbations.
From the point of view of sustainable health financing, the key policy challenge is ensuring adequate
financing for preventative NCD care at the primary health care (PHC) level. Specifically, policy makers might
ask: is there adequate financing for PHC such that low-acuity conditions (e.g., diabetes or hypertension)
can be effectively managed at lower-level facilities? Historically, Bhutan’s health expenditures have been
largely devoted to curative services for communicable diseases: amounting to nearly 55% of total health
expenditures in FY 2018/19.19 The share expended on communicable diseases is proportionately greater
even though curative care for communicable diseases is often cheaper in per-unit terms relative to NCDs.
This suggests that a health financing transition, both in how – and for what – health is financed is required in
Bhutan.

CHALLENGE 3:
IMPROVING EFFICIENCIES AND STRATEGIC PURCHASING
Challenges 1 and 2 together point towards a need to improve efficiency and introduce greater strategic
purchasing of health services in Bhutan’s health financing system, especially as disease burden shifts and
fiscal space for health tightens. Presently, the primary focus of Bhutan’s public health delivery system is on
the provision of “free” basic public health services, which generally include preventive, promotive, curative,
and rehabilitative services, in addition to advanced diagnostic and organ transplant services. However, while
the categories of services covered by the government are implicitly understood, the exact services that
ought to be financed and then provided via the public health system are less well understood. In practice,
services available to citizens are primarily supply driven: i.e., they are based on what services and medicines
are already available and easily procurable at local health centers. As such, there is not a clear understanding
or process for rationalizing expenditures within the public budget. This ambiguity, combined with escalating
healthcare costs, rising public expectations, and the emergence of more complex and costly pathologies
associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are putting the long-term financial sustainability of
Bhutan’s “free health services” at risk.
Accordingly, there is an opportunity to address growing issues of health financing sustainability by more
clearly defining what it means “to provide free access to basic public health services.” However, doing so
will require introducing new criteria, methods, and data to inform the prioritization process. Finally, although
the basic health service package may be “implicitly” defined, some of the services that are explicitly not-
covered are easier to identify. For many specialty services, the RGoB has outsourced service delivery to
neighboring countries, meaning patients often must travel to India or even Thailand for most tertiary care
services. Faced with growing demands from an aging population the RGoB must begin evaluating the fiscal
implications of providing such services through the public system.

ISSUE BRIEF 2
Creating Fiscal Space for Health
Amid an Economic Downturn
The aftereffects of the coronavirus pandemic – coupled with a worsening global economic outlook – mean
that the sustainability of Bhutan’s public spending is now an area of particular concern. Accordingly, this brief
identifies policy levers available to maintain necessary public investments in health and human capital. Equally, it
also reveals key financing constraints policymakers can expect in the short- (and medium-) term.
ESTABLISHING THE DRIVERS OF FISCAL SPACE GROWTH:
The introductory brief in this series demonstrated that – due to falling public revenues, and rising debt burden
– maintaining adequate fiscal space for health is an immediate challenge facing the health sector. Therefore,
what Bhutan’s policy leaders need now is a quick assessment of the options available to counteract the
downward pressures that are likely to be placed on public health expenditures in the short- to medium term.
Accordingly, this brief lays out available options and constraints to increasing or even sustaining Bhutan’s
public expenditures on health in the near and medium terms.

PILLAR 1. Conducive Macroeconomic Conditions:
MACRO CONDITIONS NO LONGER FAVORABLE FOR PASSIVE HEALTH SPENDING GROWTH
Strong economic growth can have transformative impacts on available fiscal space for health as it creates
favorable conditions that both organically increase available resources and provide a foundation that allows
for expansionary fiscal policy. Bhutan’s own development history demonstrates the link between macro
growth and health expenditures. Driven by strong hydropower and tourism sectors1 the size of the national
economy quadrupled between 2000 and 2020,2 and in the same period, per capita current health expenditures
increased nearly 3.75 times (Figure 1). This increase in realized fiscal space for health, measured in per capita
public expenditures on health, is attributable primarily to macro-level economic growth (Figure 2). The case
of neighboring India provides further evidence of how macro growth can directly unlock domestic fiscal
space for health: although health’s share in the public budget did not meaningfully change in India between
1995 and 2010, health expenditures nearly tripled because of average per capita GDP growth of roughly 6%.

The conducive macro environment which enabled continuous per capita public health expenditure growth
since 2000 has changed. Sustaining Bhutan’s public health expenditures is a challenge because (1) GDP
per capita has declined in the last two years and because (2) government expenditures are declining at the
same time. Like the region as a whole, Bhutan suffered sharp declines in per capita GDP across 2020 and
2021 – falling from Nu.95,000 pre-pandemic to Nu.87,798 after. Although positive growth is likely to return
in 2023, per capita GDP is not expected to reach 2019 levels until 2024/25.5 Additionally, total government
expenditures, which were at a high in 2022 (Nu.73 billion) due to counter-cyclical.6 spending from the RGoB,
are now headed into a contractionary phase (Figure 3) due, in part, to high public debt.7 Total government
expenditures as a share of GDP are likely to fall and remain at a historically low rate of 28% starting from 2023
until at least 2027. The combined impact on available fiscal space for health post-COVID-19 is as follows:
Bhutan is starting from a lower base of per capita income and a decreasing share of that income is available
for health.

PILLAR 2. Donor Assistance for Health (DAH):
PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINING EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXTERNAL REVENUES ARE ALSO LOW
Increasing the level of donor (external) assistance for health is another means through which governments
can increase fiscal space available for health. Although it may be possible to secure external assistance for
health, Bhutan already relies on external funds to finance health at a higher rate than what might be expected
for a country at its income level (Figure 6). Most other lower middle-income countries with a GDP per capita
of greater than US$3,000 have external financing ratios closer to 1%, whereas Bhutan’s is 6.1%. As such,
increasing the external financing share of total health expenditures may not be sustainable or even viable in
the long term.

PILLAR 3. Reprioritization for Health:
REPRIORITIZATION CAN BE IMPACTFUL, BUT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE
Reprioritization refers to health’s share of domestic government expenditures each year. In recent years, the
priority given to health in Bhutan has ranged from a low of 6% in 2008 to above 10.4% in 2019/20 (Figure 4).
Going forward the choice of the prioritization across the next five years can have a significant impact on the
level of resources available for health. Modeling of two simplified health financing scenarios, each based on a
different assumed health prioritization rate from 2022-2027, suggests that the difference could be as high as
US$60 per capita depending on the health reprioritization rate that takes hold in Bhutan in the coming years
(Figure 5). In the high scenario (blue dashed line in Figure 5), where health’s share of general government
expenditures is maintained at its 2020 level (~10%), Bhutan can expect per capita health expenditures to
remain within US$135-145 between 2023 and 2026. However, if the priority given to health in the budget
reverses back to the 2010-2019 average, approximately 7.6%, then per capita health expenditures may not
return to 2020 levels until 2027 (orange dashed line in Figure 5).
In FY2023/24 and beyond, as the health emergency recedes, fiscal constraints become tighter and de-
prioritized demands from other social sectors come back to the fore, it may be difficult to make a strong
case for raising, or even maintaining, historically high rates of prioritization for health in the public budget.
The key reason for this is that Bhutan’s interest payments on accumulated debts is set to rise from 3% of
total government expenditures in 2021 to nearly 11% in 2027.10 As a nation’s debt servicing burden increases,
demands from non-health sectors become more competitive in a relative sense. Furthermore, as can be seen
in Figure 4, health’s share of actual public expenditures was at a historically high rate of 10.4% in 2019 and
2020. Due to the ongoing coronavirus health emergency, high levels of budgetary prioritization for health
have been easier to maintain in FY2021/22 and in FY2022/23: the budgetary allocation to the health was
further increased to 12.9% of the total government allocation.11

PILLAR 4. Generating Health Sector Specific Resources:
BHUTAN MAY HAVE ROOM FOR INCREMENTAL “PRO-HEALTH” CONSUMPTION TAXES
Health-specific revenues are sourced generally from the form of either new earmarked taxes or from the
collection of health contributions.12 Given that Bhutan’s health sector relies almost exclusively on taxes to
fund health – tax-financed government expenditures amounted to 78% of total current health expenditures
in 2020, while voluntary or compulsory healthcare payment contributions were collectively just 2% – the
revenue potential from contributions is low in the near term. Relatedly, a key financial protection indicator,
the private out-of-pocket share of health expenditures, has trended negatively in the last few years, from 13
to 18%. In this context, introducing policies that increase the burden on private households should not be
preferred. A secondary option is to raise additional revenues though earmarking for health – particularly by
using “pro-health” consumption taxes.
Although tobacco products are banned, Bhutan may still have room to mobilize additional domestic
revenues through consumption taxes on alcohol, sugar, and sugary sweetened beverages. A comparison of
consumer prices across the South Asia region (SAR) and globally shows that Bhutanese pay less for alcoholic
beverages relative to India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the world on average (Table 1). Specifically, the average
price index for alcohol is 94 in Bhutan, which means that alcoholic products are nearly 40% cheaper than in
India and more than half as cheap as in Sri Lanka. Even a tax that raises the average price of alcohol up by
6% would only bring Bhutan in line with the global average. This provides an initial economic justification
for imposing new taxes on health impacting consumables as a mechanism through which to improve fiscal
imbalances and secure fiscal space for health.

However, international evidence suggests that not only are the revenue implications of “pro-health” taxes
often limited, securing these new revenues as earmarks for health can also be difficult and economically
inefficient. Importantly, health taxes are considered “unlikely to bring a sustained net increase in revenue” due
to the consumption offsetting effects caused by price increases.14 Accordingly, the global literature on health
taxes now emphasizes the health taxes as a public health tool best suited to curb unhealthy consumption
rather than as an instrument of fiscal policy.15 In short, pro-health taxes are an efficiency improving measure.
PILLAR 5. Efficiency in Pooling and Using Resources:
GIVEN LOW REVENUE PROSPECTS, IMPROVING EFFICIENCY MUST BECOME A FOCUS
Improving the efficiency of health expenditures, by which is meant getting more health output for the
same level of input, can act as a final source of fiscal space.16 This is because efficiency gains help free up
previously committed resources, so that they can be re-invested into new health sector priorities, thereby
creating fiscal space without needing to mobilize any new domestic revenues. This can be done either through
reallocating resources from lower yield services to higher yield services, examples include spending more
on primary care services to prevent acute exacerbations of noncommunicable disease (NCD) such as Type-1
diabetes and thus averting more disability adjusted life years (DALYs) than an inpatient hospital service that
might be required once a disease has already progressed. Alternatively, efficiencies can also be gained by
ensuring that the allocated resources are utilized optimally, this is known as technical efficiency and examples
include hospital work-flow improvements that allow doctors and nurses to operate more effectively at “top-
of-license” and see larger patient panels. In this way, there are always multiple complementary avenues
through which to realize efficiencies in a health system.
Bhutan also has a significant opportunity to address both allocative and technical inefficiencies as they
relate to NCDs. As noted in the introductory brief of this series, the rise in NCD’s share of total disease
burden has been particularly rapid in Bhutan and is expected to continue growing until at least 2050. NCDs
have increased from less than 35% of the disease burden in 2000 to over 62% by 2019, and the key drivers
are heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). And yet, despite the
rapidly growing NCD share, Bhutan’s health financing indicators have not yet begun to adequately reflect the
new reality of disease in the country. Per the most recent national health accounts, in FY2019/20 Bhutan spent
nearly 55% of its total health expenditures on curative services that relate primarily to communicable diseases.
The share spent on curative services was up by over 1.5% as compared to FY2018/19. Additionally, not only
is Bhutan allocating an inefficient proportion of its resources towards NCDs, but existing expenditures are
being utilized in a technically inefficient manner. This inefficiency can be seen by comparing NCD-related
outcomes across SAR: although Bhutan spends US$116 per capita on health, nearly twice as much as India,
Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, it scores worse on the NCD tracer indicators of the UHC essential service
coverage index than each of these countries. Bhutan’s NCD service coverage score is 47% while the average
for SAR is nearly 10 percentage points higher, at 56%.17

Finally, beyond allocative and technical efficiency, strategic purchasing represents another important policy
mechanism through which to achieve greater health for money. Conceptually strategic purchasing refers to
the deliberate directing of pooled health funds towards “priority populations, interventions, and services, and
actively creating incentives so funds are used by service providers equitably” and efficiently.19 Together with
financial risk pooling, strategic purchasing represents the “Plus” in the DRUM+ policy framework. However,
in the case of Bhutan, the RGoB’s purchasing of “basic public health services” is currently not defined in an
explicit package of essential health services that are guaranteed to citizens. Furthermore, health budgets “at
all levels of government are done by line-item and are based on historic trends rather than on need.”20
To address growing issues of health financing sustainability, it may become necessary for the RGoB to more
clearly define what it means to provide “free access to basic public health services” under an explicit health
benefits package. Without an explicitly defined package, it is difficult for the RGoB, the largest purchaser of
health services (78% of all current health expenditures in 2020), to intentionally and efficiently direct pooled
resources towards priority areas. This is particularly important in the context of Bhutan’s ongoing disease
burden transition, where service delivery needs to be re-oriented to meet growing NCD and mental health
needs. Similarly, without explicitly defined benefits packages, pursuing strategic purchasing reforms such as
capitated primary health care payments and incentive payments for quality improvement and value-based
care are harder to pursue. Implementing a defined benefits package will require introducing new criteria,
methods, and data to inform the prioritization process, as well as a national policy dialogue on the issue.
Accordingly, there remains a significant opportunity for the RGoB to explore strategic purchasing reforms to
increase available fiscal space in the medium to long term.

Table 2. Summary: Prospects for Fiscal Space
DRUM PILLAR BHUTAN
Macro-economic Limited: Bhutan is starting from lower base of per capita GDP after COVID –
prospects falling from NU.95,000 in 2019 to NU.87,798 in 2021 – and total government
expenditures as a share of GDP are likely to fall and remain at low until at least
2027. Macro conditions will not contribute to fiscal space for health and may shrink
the level of available resources.
Donor assistance Limited: Bhutan relies on external funds to finance health at a higher rate than
for health what might be expected for a country at its income level, approximately 7% of
current health expenditures. As such, increasing the external financing share of
total health expenditures may not be sustainable or even viable in the long term.
Health sector priority Low/Moderate: Reprioritization can significantly grow fiscal space, contributing
up to US$60 per capita between 2022-27 if health’s share is maintained at 10.4%.
However, as Bhutan’s macro conditions tighten and demands from non-health
sectors that were de-prioritized during COVID get louder, it may be difficult to
convince MoF to raise, or even maintain, health’s high priority in the budget.
Sector-specific Moderate: Although tobacco products are banned, Bhutan shows room to
revenues mobilize domestic revenues through consumption taxes on alcohol, sugar, and
sugary sweetened beverages. For example, alcoholic products are nearly 40%
cheaper in Bhutan than in India and 50% cheaper than in Sri Lanka. Accordingly,
there is some economic justification for imposing new consumption taxes, which
can in turn improve current fiscal imbalances and secure fiscal space for health.
Efficiency in pooling Good: Bhutan has a significant opportunity to address both allocative and
and using resources technical inefficiencies as they relate to NCDs. Given low or moderate prospects
for fiscal space from other DRUM pillars, improving efficiency and making
additional room within the existing resource envelop should become a primary
focus in the near term.

ISSUE BRIEF 3
Expenditure Efficiency in the Bhutanese Health System
This issue brief provides an introductory assessment of efficiency (and inefficiency) in Bhutan’s health financing
system—understood simply as health outputs and outcomes per given input. Through a comparison of system-
level indicators against international benchmarks, broad areas of success as well as opportunity are highlighted.
Bhutan has increased its real per capita health expenditures at a fast rate—such that its per capita health
spending has caught up to regional and income benchmarks. In 2000, Bhutan’s current health expenditures
was US$48.7 per capita (measured in constant 2020 US$), two decades later, current health expenditures
had increased nearly threefold: to US$133.7 per capita in 2020. In comparison, the region of South Asia and
lower middle income (LMI) countries, on average, saw real increases in current health expenditures per capita
of 2.3 and 2.2 times respectively. In short, Bhutan has been increasingly investing in health (Figure 1 below).
The question from a sustainable health financing point of view now becomes— particularly during periods of
limited fiscal space—how efficient are these health expenditures?
Definitive assessments of efficiency, particularly across complex systems like a national health sector, are
often difficult, spanning across the domains of technical, allocative, and sometime administrative efficiency.
One simplified approach to understanding efficiency in the health sector, however, is to consider system-
level inputs against health outputs—i.e., to measure the total amount invested in health (e.g., current health
expenditures per capita) against other aggregate output indicators (e.g., UHC attainment). Accordingly, the
goal of this short policy brief is to place Bhutan’s efficiency performance in international comparison and
highlight, for policymakers, broad areas of relative spending efficiency (or inefficiency) in the existing health
financing system.
Figure 1. Relative Increases in Real per capita Health Expenditures in South Asia, 2000 to 20201
BHUTAN HAS BEEN AN EFFICIENT MATERNAL, NEWBORN AND CHILD HEALTH (MNCH)
PERFORMER, HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT UNFINISHED AGENDA REMAINS.
Efficiency can be grasped by comparing Bhutan’s MNCH outcomes directly against its income and
regional comparators. For instance, Bhutan spends approximately US$10 per capita less on health than
the LMI country average2 yet its performance on the MNCH essential services sub-index is approximately
15 percentage points higher than the LMI country average (83.3% compared to 68.8%) (Figure 2). Similarly,
1 Source: WHO GHED 2023 Edition. 2 Current per capita health expenditures in Bhutan were US$115 compared to the LMI country average of
US$125 per capita in 2019, the latest year for which comparable UHC sub-index data was available.

using maternal mortality as a representative example of maternal health outcomes, Bhutan performs better
than the expected indicator value given its specific level of per capita inputs: In 2020, estimates from the
World Health Organization’s Global Health Expenditure Dataset (WHO GHED) show that Bhutan invested
approximately US$7.25 per capita specifically on maternal conditions, while the maternal mortality ratio
(MMR) was 60.0 deaths per 100,000 live births (Figure 3). Based on the experiences of 65 developing
countries for which data was available, the expected MMR for a country investing US$7.25 per capita on
maternal conditions is approximately 243 deaths per 100,000.

Although MNCH progress has been significant, serious issues remain with access, quality, and utilization
of services—particularly for more rural residents. Under-5 mortality has been reduced from over 77 deaths
per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 26.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021—a 65% improvement. However,
most pregnant women and mothers do not attend the minimum required number of antenatal and postnatal
care visits set by the Ministry of Health due to financial burden linked to opportunity costs associated with
transportation and loss of daily wages/workdays, competing household priorities of women (household
chores and farm work takes precedence over accessing health care), and social and cultural beliefs and
norms coupled with family pressure and health illiteracy. A clear need exists to further the MNCH agenda
in Bhutan. The data show that Bhutan’s public sector driven health system has been relatively efficient in
utilizing available resources to improve MNCH outcomes to-date, suggesting that additional investments in
this domain may also yield high value.
CONVERSELY, BHUTAN APPEARS AS AN INEFFICIENT PERFORMER WHEN IT COMES TO
ADDRESSING NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS)—MAKING NCDS AN OPPORTUNITY AREA.
INCDs have been rising rapidly in recent decades in Bhutan. The total disability adjusted life years, or DALYs,
attributable to the top four NCDs, heart disease, diabetes, COPD,6 and stroke, have each increased by 20%-
to-50% in the last ten years.7 This trend is expected to continue: aging is a key risk factor for NCDs and the
share of the Bhutanese population aged 65 and older will triple in the next three decades from roughly
6% to 16%,8 all while fertility rates continue to fall. While a rise in the relative importance of NCDs is to be
expected as societies age, the current demographic and epidemiological trends mean that a larger share of
the Bhutanese population is increasingly impacted by NCDs. Equally, a larger and larger share of healthcare
service utilization in Bhutan will be skewed toward the treatment of NCDs and the long-term management of
chronic conditions such as cancers, diabetes and hypertension. Accordingly, it is important to understand the
relative efficiency of Bhutan’s healthcare system, as it stands today, in addressing the rising NCD challenge.
Figure 4. UHC Sub-index on
Noncommunicable Diseases
and per capita Health
Expenditures, by Country
Bhutan’s health system has historically been oriented towards communicable diseases and accordingly
NCDs service access and outcomes are lower than what might be expected at its current health spending
levels. Figure 4 (above) shows that service coverage for essential NCD services was 48% of the Bhutanese
population (measured using tracer NCD indicators defined under the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8
regarding the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC)). However, the expected NCD essential service
coverage at Bhutan’s level of per capita current health expenditures is approximately 60%. Furthermore,
regional neighbors Bangladesh, India, and Nepal each score higher on the NCD service coverage sub-index
than does Bhutan, despite considerably lower per capita health spending.

ISSUE BRIEF 4
Ageing & NCDs Impact on Health Financing
Bhutan is experiencing a rapid process of population ageing and a related shift in mortality and burden
attritubalte to noncommunicable diseases. This brief first highlights the health financing challenges created by
the ongoing demographic and epidemiological transitions, and then outlines the shape of potential solutions to
those challenges.
Bhutan has experienced a rapid change in its burden of disease toward noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)
over the last three decades: and its transition has been faster than in several peer countries (Figure 1).
Measured as a percentage of total disease burden, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with
NCDs has increased from 23% in 1990 to 62% in 2019. Over this period, ongoing population ageing as well as
changing lifestyles and popular dietary habits1 have meant that cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory
disease, cancers, and diabetes have overtaken infectious, maternal, and neonatal disorders as the top causes
of premature mortality.2 Bhutan’s epidemiological transition is faster than in neighboring India or Nepal, and
even more rapid than the average experience of Lower Middle Income (LMI) countries.
While the trends from the last three decades are clear, looking thirty years forward, Bhutan’s demographic
indicators suggest that NCD share will continue to rise. Population estimates show that the share of the
population aged 65+ will nearly triple between 2020 and 2050, from 6% to 16%.3 As Bhutan’s population
ages, its NCD burden will commensurately increase given that ageing is itself a risk factor for NCDs, including
cancers, hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular conditions.
Figure 1. Change in Disease Burden in Bhutan and Peer Countries (1990-2019)
To date, Bhutan’s healthcare delivery system has been primarily oriented towards the care and treatment
of communicable and basic maternal and child health conditions. Improvements in maternal, newborn,
child, and adolescent health (MNCAH) outcomes have be impressive over the last few decades: infant
mortality reduced from 83 deaths per 1,000 live births (1990) to 23 deaths per 1,000 live births (2019).5

Similarly, impressive improvements have been recorded in access to institutional deliveries: for example,
the percentage of births attended by skilled health staff increased from 27% in 2000 to above 96% in 2019.6
At the same time, through the implementation of a national strategy, mortality caused by malaria infections
has been reduced by 99%.7 Although aspects of the communicable disease agenda remain unfinished in
Bhutan, the rapid growth of NCDs requires a transformation of the health service delivery system.
Recognizing that preventing, treating, and managing NCDs is the future of healthcare in Bhutan, the Royal
Government of Bhutan’s (RGoB) Ministry of Health has already begun instituting important service delivery
reforms. First, starting as early as 2009, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) package of essential NCD
interventions (PEN) was incrementally introduced into the primary care system. Since then, the RGoB has
passed The Multisectoral National Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs (2015)8, and piloted
an innovative service delivery redesign initiative specifically to help manage NCDs in the population—the
Service with Care and Compassion Initiative (SCCI).9 Through the SCCI, the RGoB is pursuing a strategy
of opportunistic screening for priority NCDs—whereby all patients entering health facilities are screened
regardless of initial reason of visit. As of September 2020, the SCCI was scaled from four districts to all twenty
districts across the country. Going forward, more dedicated efforts may be necessary, including population-
based screening approaches.
KEY INSIGHT 1
ALONGSIDE TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM, BHUTAN’S
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SHIFT WILL REQUIRE A STRATEGIC RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH
FINANCING SYSTEM AS WELL.
Global evidence indicates that a rising share of NCDs—even as overall disease burden decreases—will
lead to higher system-level costs. This is primarily due to the chronic nature of most NCDs, including
cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and kidney diseases, which have higher medical costs and require longer-
term medication regimens relative to most communicable diseases. As countries transition towards NCD-
skewed disease burdens, per capita current health expenditures tend to steadily increase. The same trends
are being observed in Bhutan as well.
Recent evidence from Bhutan shows that aggregate health system expenditures as well as per unit
healthcare costs are increasing—even after controlling for inflation. Insights from the recently completed
Bhutan Healthcare Costing Analysis (2023) show that at Bhutan’s major referral hospitals, the total costs
have increased by as much as 62% in the last 10 years—reflecting a rise that outpaces general inflation in
the Bhutanese economy.10 Similar trends have been observed in the same period in average per unit costs,
measured as per bed day costs, at the major referral hospitals. At a system-wide level, the latest National
Health Accounts exercise (NHA 2021) notes that there has been “an exponential increase of current health
expenditures over the recent years.”11 Total current health expenditures, which were approximately Nu.6.2
billion in FY2019/20, increased 22% year-over-year in FY2019/20 and 17% in FY2018/19 as compared to the
previous fiscal year. In contrast, overall inflation in Bhutan in 2018 and 2019 was measured at only 1.8% and
0.9% respectively. Given that health is almost entirely publicly delivered—over 80% of total current health
expenditures were financed by the government in FY2019/20—Bhutan’s rising health costs place direct
pressure on the RGoB’s budgetary commitments.
Conversely, policy leaders should realize that population ageing will have a negative impact on health
sector revenues as well. Between 2020 and 2060, the share of Bhutan’s population aged 65 and older is
expected to quadruple: from 6% to 24% (Table 1). This ageing trend raises health financing sustainability
concerns due to slower health sector revenue growth because of fewer working-age people.12 Accordingly,
health financing systems that rely on payroll contributions are most at risk from ageing. Although Bhutan
does not utilize social contributions, its health revenues are still vulnerable to ageing because a decline in
the working-age population share implies slowed growth in income tax revenues and potentially also lower
productivity in the labor market.13 In fact, with current ageing trends and without any changes in policy,
the RGoB can expect a financing gap equivalent to US$27 per person (or 0.3 percent of GDP) by 2060.14

Policy measures, including increasing the taxes levied on corporate profits and capital gains, as well as
consumption taxes, can help minimize the expected financing gap from the revenue side.

As Figure 215 shows, an important health financing challenge as it relates to the NCD and ageing transition is
managing anticipated healthcare cost inflation in line with anticipated revenue growth. It is crucial to ensure
adequate funding for (1) preventative interventions and (2) comprehensive NCD care at the primary health
care (PHC) level. This is because of the gradual, long-term, and fluctuating nature of NCDs: left unmanaged,
NCDs generally exhibit slow onset, remain as chronic illness that impact health with fluctuating intensity, and
may eventually lead to acute exacerbations that need costly and high-intensity levels of care. Furthermore,
NCDs are also commonly comorbid—i.e., patients can suffer from multiple chronic conditions at once—
thus necessitating simultaneous and complex treatment plans. In this way, NCDs are often differentiated
from infectious and communicable diseases, which tend to be much more episodic, require time-limited
medication regiments, and are fully curable.
The long-term nature of most NCDs means that health systems have an opportunity to significantly
impact overall cost and health outcomes. This can be achieved through early detection and long-term care
management such that costly hospitalizations are avoided where possible.
Figure 3. Health Financing and the NCD Patient Trajectory
Accordingly, there is a need to understand the current state of Bhutan’s health financing for NCDs,
and to assess whether the current arrangements are effectively incentivizing cost-effective NCD care
management. Using both global experiences and local analysis, the remainder of this policy brief summarizes
the current state of NCD financing in Bhutan and provides options to finance the ongoing disease burden
transition sustainably and innovatively.

KEY INSIGHT 2
BHUTAN WILL NEED TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN NCD PREVENTION AND CONTROL—BUT
THESE INVESTMENTS CAN BE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND YIELD OUTSIZED RETURNS.
At present, Bhutan spends less than 0.5% of its current health expenditures on NCD prevention and
control.16 The RGoB’s Multisectoral National Action Plan for NCDs (2015), which outlines multiple programs
for NCD control, notes that such programs are to be primarily financed through direct government budgetary
transfers. Data from the most recent National Health Accounts show that budgetary line items for NCD
prevention and control functions account for only 0.2% of total current health expenditures in FY2019/20—
down from 0.5% in the 2018/19 fiscal year.17 While the relative amounts invested in NCD prevention and control
programs have declined, the direct NCD burden, understood both in terms of economic cost and health
cost, has been increasing: 41% of all current health expenditures in FY2019/20 were linked to NCD-related
diagnoses, the largest share among disease categories, and up from 38% in FY2018/19. The continuously
rising share of NCDs in national health expenditures, and in the national disease burden, implies that the
current levels of investment in NCD prevention and control are insufficient.
This raises an important question: how much ought to be spent on upstream NCD prevention? While
comparative data on exactly what share of current health expenditures should be allocated for preventative
and NCD control programs is sparse, a recent report published in The Lancet by the NCD Countdown 2030
collaborators group notes that most LMICs will need to spend “approximately 20% of government health
expenditure” on high-priority interventions or a locally-prioritized NCD package in order to meet the target
set under Sustainable Development Goal 3.4.18 The gap between Bhutan’s less-than-1% on NCD prevention
and control and The NCD Countdown 2030 collaborators group’s 20% benchmark is large and suggests that
additional resources need to be mobilized. Despite suffering major health and economic shocks from the
COVID-19 economic crisis, Bhutan’s medium-term growth outlook remains robust, especially considering
revenues anticipated from two new major hydropower projects expected to come online in 2024/25.19
Global evidence suggests that NCD financing can be focused on a narrow set of high-priority PHC
interventions and still yield extremely high economic and human capital returns. For instance, economic
assessments of five basic NCD prevention and early management interventions therapies have estimated
an average 9:1 return on investment for every dollar spent by the health system on NCD therapies, and
their results were constant across high- and low/lower-middle income settings.21 Separately, a recent

assessment on the impact on NCD-related mortality for Malawi shows that scale up of just three priority
NCD interventions—(i) “Aspirin for suspected ACS22”, (ii) “Early-stage cervical cancer screening/treatment”,
(iii) and “Treatment of early-stage breast cancer”—would be enough to help the country meet its SDG 3.4
targets by 2030, and avert 3,000 deaths at a cost of US$1,500 per life.23 Accordingly, with local disease
burden and cost effectiveness data, health sector policy leaders may be able to make robust arguments for
incremental investments in NCD control.
KEY INSIGHT 3
BHUTAN WILL NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE CURRENT HEALTH FINANCING SYSTEM FOR
NCDS IS INCENTIVIZING—OR DISINCENTIVIZING—COST EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY.
To incentivize cost effective NCD treatments, Bhutan will need to introduce health financing and strategic
purchasing reforms. Utilization data from Bhutan’s highest level referral hospitals shows that nearly 6% of
all inpatient department (IPD) admissions during the 2018/19 financial year could be attributed to the single
NCD, hypertension. A further 3.2% of all admissions were attributed to diabetes. Together this means that
nearly 10% of all admissions at referral hospitals—i.e., Bhutan’s most expensive care setting—are associated
with NCDs that are commonly considered to be ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC).24 25 ACSCs, as
defined by the WHO, are conditions for which “hospitalizations can be avoided by timely and effective care
in ambulatory” or other primary care settings.
Results from the most recent Bhutan Healthcare Costing Analysis (2023) report show that the cost of
incurring a single ACSC admission can be up to 50 times as high as a OPD visit. Disease specific IPD cost
estimates show that an admission at the major referral hospitals can cost between Nu.45,079 and Nu.53,380
for diabetes, and between Nu. 24,615 and Nu.29,809 for hypertension. In comparison, the cost of a single
outpatient visit at the same referrals hospitals costs an average of only Nu.1,011. The significant difference
between the unit costs of IPD and OPD utilization make clear the high costs of untreated and unmanaged
NCDs to Bhutan’s long term health financing sustainability. Equally, however, the low cost of OPD visits
relative to potentially avoidable admission implies a significant opportunity to improve efficiency in NCD
financing for Bhutan.
What health-financing levers are available to incentivize the management of high-prevalence NCDs,
particularly ACSCs, in the community and outpatient settings? As Chukwuma, Lylozian and Gong (2021)
note in a recent paper, to reduce the financial burden from NCDs on country health systems “there is a
need to increase the access to primary health care” that includes “services for ambulatory care sensitive
conditions such as for uncomplicated diabetes mellitus.”26 In other words, to addresses ACSCs in Bhutan,
primary healthcare facilities need to be equipped to provide the necessary NCD-screening, prevention and
management services, and these primary care services need to be readily accessible to citizens. This in
turn implies that primary care facilities need adequate financing and resource provisioning. Finally, while
prevention of ACSC through increased access to PHC at community health centers and first-level hospitals
is the first order policy objective, given the high price of admissions it is also important to address costs at
the major referral center level as well. Accordingly, this policy brief concludes by providing examples to spur
policy dialogue on future health financing and purchasing innovations in Bhutan.
EXAMPLE 1
POPULATION-BASED OR “PER FAMILY” PRE-PAYMENTS FOR PRIMARY CARE:
In the Philippines, PhilHealth has been purchasing PHC services from the public sector not on a per-service
reimbursement basis or via line-item budgets, but on a prospective per-family basis. This means that health
facilities are assigned specific families based on a geographic catchment area, and then a set capitation
payment is released to health facilities based on the sum of assigned families. This financing mechanism is
being used to finance PHC services at rural health units and other public sector health centers. In 2019, the
original primary care benefit (termed Primary Care Benefit 1) was updated into the Expanded Primary Care
Benefit, with specific incentives introduced for the prevention and management of priority NCDs, including
bonus payments for medication maintenance of diabetes and hypertension patients.27 By the end of 2022,
the PhilHealth had successfully attributed over 780,000 members to a preferred primary care provider where

members were incentivized to avail free preventative NCD screenings, consultations and assessments.28
Furthermore, survey data suggests that when preventative PHC service coverage is expanded to beneficiaries,
including the poor and marginalized members, utilization tends to be high: nearly 70% of surveyed poor
PhilHealth members had availed at least one covered preventative PHC service in the last year.29
In Bhutan, transitioning away from input-based line-item budgets, and towards output- or population-
based capitation payments can help financially integrate service delivery transformation efforts like the
SCCI into the existing PHC system. Such per-family PHC capitation payments provide resources upfront to
health facilities without the limitations of line-item budgets to allow facilities and providers to flexible execute
the new care tasks involved in proactive NCD management—including home-based screenings for NCDs.
Unintended consequences, such as reductions in utilization that sometimes accompany capitation payment
models, can be mitigated by using blended approaches that retain elements of fee-for-service payments to
financially incentivize a minimum level of utilization or penalize under-delivery.30
EXAMPLE 2
NCD-SPECIFIC BUNDLED PAYMENTS FOR HOSPITAL PROVIDERS:
Options to manage costs at the highest tier of the care continuum—i.e., inpatient hospitals—include a
special form of capitation that is limited to the single care episode. The Lancet Global Health Commission
on Financing Primary Healthcare defines such bundled payments as “a single payment in the form of a lump
sum” per episode or condition per patient and made to a “collective of providers”.31 The Netherlands has
introduced bundled payments primarily for NCDs like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.32 In the
United States, bundled payments have also been used to help manage costs from high volume procedures
such as routine deliveries. In the hospital setting, the purpose of bundled payments is to incentivize better
care coordination and resource management among healthcare providers involved in complicated patient
care. In effect, hospitals are incentivized to participate in controlling their own cost growth as there is potential
to retain the difference between actual delivery costs and the bundled payment value. The retained funds
can then be re-invested in the hospital in service of quality and capital infrastructure improvements.
As countries move towards greater use of bundled payments—and value-based care purchasing mechanisms
more generally—the evidence for the value of these policies is also becoming clearer. “Bundled-payment
models have had predominantly positive impacts on both spending and quality of care, irrespective of
country, medical procedure, or condition and applied research methodology.”33 In Bhutan, where the average
inflation-adjusted cost of an inpatient admission has increased by 33% at the referral hospitals and by 10%
at the district hospitals between FY2009/10 and FY 2018/19, payment reforms that help to manage hospital
expenditures are both necessary and will be complimentary to PHC-focused reforms. Both will contribute to
sustainable health financing in the medium- and long-terms.
CONCLUSION
Bhutan’s health system has historically been oriented towards communicable and basic maternal and child
health conditions—with significant progress achieved over the last three decades. Although important last-
mile access and equity issues remain on the communicable and RMNCH side, Bhutan is also concurrently
experiencing rapid changes in its burden of disease: The NCD share of total disease burden has increased
from 23% in 1990 to 62% in 2019. This means the NCD burden is rising faster in Bhutan than in other regional
countries and faster than the lower middle-income country average. Bhutan’s population is also aging fast:
the share of 65+ is likely to triple in the next three decades, from 6% to nearly 20% of the population.
Changing disease and demographic mix have direct implications on health financing sustainability in
Bhutan. First, a rising NCD disease burden can push per capita current health expenditures upwards, even if
overall disease burden is decreasing, because of the chronic nature of most NCDs—including cardiovascular,
respiratory, cancer and kidney diseases, which have higher medical costs and require longer-term medication
regimens relative to most communicable diseases. Evidence from Bhutan shows that aggregate health system
expenditures as well as per unit healthcare costs are increasing—even after controlling for inflation. Second,
ageing can negatively impact general government and public health sector revenues as the population

dependency ratio increases and the size of the working age population decreases in relative terms.
In response to changing disease and demographic patterns, Bhutan needs not just service delivery
transformations, but also a transformation of its existing public health financing system. Data from
Bhutan shows that public expenditures on NCD prevention and control programs is low (0.2% of total
health expenditures in FY2019/20),34 while the direct economic cost of NCD has high, 41% of current health
expenditures in FY2019/20 were linked to NCD-related diagnoses. Furthermore, nearly 10% of all admissions
at Bhutan’s referral hospitals are associated with NCDs that could have been managed in an outpatient setting
with regular care management (i.e., ACSCs). These data, along with global experiences, suggest that an
emphasis on strengthening and prioritizing PHC, including efforts to improve fiscal autonomy and flexibility
of community level PHC centers, will be key. A more comprehensive and systematic look at the prevalence
of ACSCs in hospital admissions in Bhutan can help health sector policymakers focus their attention on
specific areas in the PHC system that require strengthening. Targeted investments in PHC improvement
would help mitigate and manage the growing NCD burden and help improve overall efficiency of Bhutan’s
health financing system.
