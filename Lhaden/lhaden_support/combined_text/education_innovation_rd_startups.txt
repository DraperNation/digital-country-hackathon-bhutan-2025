Tales from DoEE
The Work from Home Blessing!
I was almost on the verge of quitting my decade old job as a civil servant. The
joy of having my third bundle of joy soon came to an end when my 6 months of
maternity leave exhausted and work from home was not given as an option for
me. With no one to look after my infant and work demanding my presence, I
was literally left with no option other than to quit the government job. I tried
adjusting keeping my baby at my sister in-law’s place, but it only disturbed me
more when I got called back even before I hit my office. My infant would be
crying intolerably in a new place and nothing else other than my presence would
soothe her. I would have to run back to a shriveled dried-up voice but still crying
baby of mine. Nothing really mattered and I decided to quit. I was experiencing
a whole new level of stress than ever before. A crying baby seeking my attention
on one hand and my demanding job on the other.
That’s when Aum Kunzang Lhamu, the Director General of the Department of
Type text here
Employment and Entrepreneurship (DoEE) stepped into my rescue. She
immediately empathized my plight and straightaway granted me the flexibility to
work from home. This I believe came at the cost of having to justify to the
institution for breaking away from the traditional 9-5 work culture and the
mandatory physical attendance which is sought in our system.
Working from home, of course, did not come as seamlessly as I thought it would,
with a whining baby by the side, but it certainly eased me from so many other
matters. It gave me the flexibility to work any time in the comfort presence of
my baby. My schedule shifted from the regular 9AM-5PM roster to work in
between my baby’s nap and after 9 PM when she was put to sleep. It wasn’t easy
but it was manageable. I had no worries of having to leave my baby behind and
I was freed from the burden of having to look for a babysitter.
My baby is now 2 and a half years old, and she is matured enough to understand
that mommy must leave for work. I have resumed my regular work and
submitted all my work reports carried out during the WFH period. I am proud
to admit that I have productive results to show which would not never have
happened if I was not granted the flexibility. Words alone are not enough to
thank my DG for the support she has shown towards a mother like me who
otherwise would have lost her career. This article is just a token of my gratitude
for the enormous role she took to help me attend to my baby and my career.

And for those leaders wondering what do a working mother need? A supportive
manager is a good start! Labelling mothers on maternity leave under the “need
improvement” category is a huge discouragement!

Entrepreneurship Diaries
Galley LED Lighting
I have always wanted to explore my potential as an entrepreneur and my
aspirations were realized when I initially got the opportunity to participate in
Basic Entrepreneurship Course conducted by Entrepreneurship Promotion
Division under Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship of Ministry
of Labour & Human Resources. After attending the course my motivation to
pursue my entrepreneurial aspirations increased and having learned how to spot
opportunities and plan for an enterprise my confidence only grew.
I found myself participating in Bhutan New Venture Challenge 2022 and bagging
the first position with Nu. 250,000 as cash prize. Today, I am ready to launch my
business “Galley LED Lighting” and have my products in the market and
hopefully lighting homes soon.
I owe Department of Employment
and Entrepreneurship a lot from
allowing me to explore my potential
to establish my own venture in the
form of “Galley LED Lights”. I am
looking forward to my career as an
entrepreneur.
The programs of the Ministry have
been beneficial to me and I am sure it
will help youths like me who are
willing to learn and are interested to
explore one’s own potential. I have
been recommending the Ministry’s
programs to my friends and for all the
support and guidance and for where I
have reached today, I will always hold
the Department in the highest of
regards.

Bhutan Instant Surveying
After completing his Diploma in Survey Engineering from Jigme Namgyel
Engineering College, Tshewang worked at the National Land Commission
Secretariat (NLCS) as a contract employee and at another private company for a few
years.
While he gained valuable experience working for different organizations, Tshewang
saw an opportunity to not only become self-employed but also create employment
for the other young people. He realized that land survey is a much sought-after
service, yet NLCS was the only agency providing the service.
So, when the NLCS privatized and certified few service providers, Tshewang
grabbed the opportunity to set up his firm. His goal is to employ others like him
because he realized that there aren’t many job opportunities for people with a
diploma in survey engineering.
He attended various available entrepreneurs training provided by entrepreneur-
support organizations to gain knowledge and skills. He bagged the best entrepreneur
award at the Basic Entrepreneurship Course (BEC) by Ministry of Labour and
Human Resources in 2020, won another award at the Bhutan New Venture
Challenge by MoLHR, first prize at Loden Foundation's Loden SEED training in
2020 and received interest and collateral free loan from Loden in 2021.
Based in Thimphu, his firm
‘Bhutan Instant Surveying (BIS),’
provides cadastral survey,
land/flat transaction, engineering
survey services like building
foundation layout, building

services.

Intern Diaries
Message from Kuenzang, Tandin and Poonam (Availed intern support under YELP program)
Elizabeth Berg says, “There is an incredible value in being of service to others” and today
there is an overwhelming need for nurses and health workers in the health care
setting such as in the national and referral hospitals. It was a proud moment for
us, because we were able to give up our time for a few hours of sleep and help
those patients who really need a nurse-to-patient relationship in getting them
better and healthier. It was not only a contribution
to the community but also helped the three of us
grow professionally as well as personally.
Positive benefit from my internship journey:
• Gained confidence
• Documentation and recording skills
• Communication skills
• Assisting doctors
• Adjust with different types of people
• Rapport building
• Developed patience
Depending on the different ward where we have been
posted we experienced various situations and learned
to cope with it. We had a great time working with the
staff and patients. We are always grateful to all the
nurses, patients, doctors, and MoLHR staffs for their
continued support during our internship.

Young jobseekers: Unemployed or limited?
Jobseekers today face two major challenges. One is that, technical skills and
competencies are not treated as important and sought-after as ‘work experience’
in the Bhutanese labour market. Jobseekers lose the race before it starts. They
are limited by the requirement of needing working experience of 2, 5,10, or 15
years, when they are barely out of school or graduated.
The second one is ‘work attitude’. While new jobseekers have lower access to
the opportunities, they are further hindered by negative perceptions towards
manual and labour-intensive or blue-collar jobs. The majority of the new entrants
and jobseekers remain unemployed, hopeful for a job that meets their aspirations
and expectations.

Support to Women’s Group Under Targeted Employment Program
The Ministry of Labor and Human Resources under its post skilling support
interventions supported unemployed youth, women, elderly, single parents and
persons with disability and also encouraged them to opt for self-employment.
These groups were supported through provision of equipment to help them
establish and make use of their skills acquired through various training and skills
development programs. One of the major hurdles for these group are lack of
financial support to set up business and also high cost associated with business
establishment.
The Ministry in collaboration with UNDP has been working to promote
entrepreneurship through provision of equipment which has culminated into
successful business ventures and also has encouraged and motivated these group
to take their skills and ideas forward. During FY 2021-22, MoLHR supported
15 covid impacted female workers (Dheydhen Zhitshog Thuendrel Tshogpa
tailoring Group) by providing tailoring equipment after availing skills training in
tailoring under the Ministry’s Skills Development Plan (SDP)

Chapter One
Department Profile
The Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship is focused on promoting
and facilitating gainful employment through the provision of effective
employment and entrepreneurship. This is realized through formulating policies
concerning employment promotion and employment creation working closely
with the Ministry’s Policy and Planning Division (PPD). The policy-making is
based on the evidence and insights collected through rigorous consultation with
the various stakeholders. The policies are implemented with best practice models
and methods that suit our local needs and objectives.
The Department plays a critical role in the employment creation process and
facilitating gainful engagement of youth in the labour market. The Department
is guided by the National Employment Policy (NEP). The NEP 2013 outlines
strategies that will accelerate employment growth, improve the quality of working
conditions and provide equal employment opportunities, while addressing the
requirement of producing an adequately skilled workforce aligned to the
requirements of the job market1.
Based on the policy mandates, the Department is focused on delivering effective
services towards facilitating the demand and supply of human resources in the
labour market. This entails providing high quality job and talent matching
services based on data and information obtained through our labour market
information system. The Department aims to assist fresh jobseekers increase
their employability and gain experience through engagement programs. The
Department is also leveraging on promoting entrepreneurship as an alternative
measure to creating employment.
The Department offers a myriad of other services apart from facilitating job-
talent matching service. It supports private employment agencies as
complementary service providers for recruitment employment facilitation
services. Career guidance and employment counselling are also rendered to the
job seekers.
The Department is comprised of two divisions, a newly established Information
and Career Guidance Unit (ICGU), and the Regional Offices which work closely
to realize the overall objectives of the Department.

Department Profile Annual Report 2021-22
The Employment Services Division (ESD) focuses on matching job and
talent in the national labour market as well as placing job seekers overseas. To
meet this objective the Division has adopted strategies that employ both in
person and online service delivery systems. The in-person services are rendered
through its Employment Service Centers (ESC) located strategically around the
country, with an emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. The
ESC services are extensively marketed to both employers and job seekers around
the country to create effective platforms for these actors to find what they are
looking for in the labour market. The online services are delivered through the
MoLHR-Management Information System (MoLHR-MIS). The Division’s
service delivery is guided by values such as equality, equity, diversity and
inclusiveness and its special purpose programs cater towards bringing
employment to differently-abled persons, developing work experience, and
targeted measures to address youth unemployment. Guiding school drop-outs
towards finding a decent career entail providing service with empathy. The
Division works closely with schools and teachers to guide students towards a
career-oriented future. The Division also strives to link people with jobs and
training opportunities through its online and self-help information services.
The Entrepreneurship Promotion Division (EPD) focuses on self-
employment and business start-up through entrepreneurship support and
development activities. Entrepreneurship is the catalyst for economic
development in any country. Entrepreneurship is viewed as one of the key
solutions in tackling unemployment issues through self-employment and import
substitution through formation of ventures concerned with production of goods
and services. The division collaborates with other similar agencies and different
financial institutions to facilitate self-employment and entrepreneurship. The
Entrepreneurship Promotion Division focuses on promoting the culture of
entrepreneurship through capacity building, entrepreneurship education, various
events and infrastructure support such as Fablabs and incubation centers to
enhance the entrepreneurship ecosystem.
The Information and Career Guidance Unit (ICGU) which is a newly
established unit under the DoEE focusing on career guidance, job-search
assistance, and job placement. The Organizational Development Report 2019
indicated a lack of career counseling services in the Ministry. The report
recommended the creation of a pool of occupational psychologists and career
counseling professionals. International research has also shown that proper
career guidance improves labour market outcomes of job seekers reducing
mismatch in supply and demand of labour, ensures lifelong learning; and helps
7 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR

achieve social equity and social inclusion. With the establishment of ICGU,
rigorous advocacies related to career and labour market have been carried out.
The ICGU spearheads the GOWA, an information dissemination program
including on-the-spot recruitment.
The Regional Offices serve as the functional arm of the Ministry. The Regional
Offices discharge its roles and responsibilities to ensure that all the activities,
initiatives and programs of the Ministry reaches a wider audience across
Bhutan. The Regional Offices are located at Gelephu, Phuentsholing, Samdrup
Jongkhar, and Trashigang. The Regional offices have played a critical role in
connecting labour market information, and other critical initiatives of the
Ministry to the nooks and corners of the country.

2.1 Youth Engagement and Livelihood Program (YELP)
Background
In keeping with the mandate of providing gainful employment, the Ministry
developed many strategies and programs to engage youth meaningfully. In the
course of implementing the programs, emphasis has been on engaging youth to
encourage them to be productive instead of doling out unemployment benefits
that tend to promote idleness and discourage working. The Government also
recognized the need to prioritize sectors of engagement such as agriculture and
construction for better use of limited resources and impacts. Therefore, the
Youth Engagement and Livelihood Program (YELP) was launched.
YELP
The Youth Engagement and Livelihood Program (YELP) is one of the key
support programs of the Department to enhance the employability of jobseekers
in transition from different schools and institutions. YELP has been designed to
benefit both employers and jobseekers. Monthly allowance of Nu. 5000 is
provided to jobseekers engaged with different employers. The support duration
ranges from 3 to 12 months. YELP provides wage subsidy support for the
engagement of jobseekers in the non-civil service sectors and an avenue for
jobseekers to gain on-the-job skills and work experience required to enhance
their employability while also supporting their livelihood. The Program was
reviewed in July 2020 and a second revision was made on July 2021 to
accommodate COVID-19 affected individuals and laid off employees from
affected sectors. In order to support those affected by the pandemic, the age
bracket and qualification ceilings were waived off.

2.2 Overseas Employment Program
As per the Cabinet directives (C-3/3/30 dated 21st August, 2013), the Ministry
was instructed to explore overseas employment. The Overseas Employment
Program (OEP) was initiated along with other employment facilitation programs
in 2013 and approved by the Cabinet (letter C-3/7/80 dated 26th September
2013).
The overseas placement was kept on hold since 5th March 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, it resumed from November 2021.
OEP was identified as a program that would be able to meaningfully engage
youth in terms of developing their skills while providing them opportunity to
earn and explore.
Modality of the Program
The placement of job seekers overseas for employment is carried out either
directly through the MoLHR or through the registered Bhutanese overseas
employment agencies (RBOEAs). The MoLHR has collaboration with some
government agencies (public–public partnership) for implementation of certain
programs while it also facilitates placements directly with the potential overseas
companies (public-private partnership). Similarly, the RBOEAs collaborate
either directly with the potential overseas companies or with recruitment agents
of the destination country (private-private partnership).

2.4. Build Bhutan Project
Background
The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted on various sectors of the
economy in the country. The construction sector was severely affected by the
pandemic and a huge employment gap was created. Therefore, as an immediate
intervention to this concern, the Build Bhutan Project was initiated and
implemented by the MoLHR over a period of two years to address
unemployment by filling the gap in the construction sector. The Build Bhutan
Project was launched on 1st July 2020 and was implemented till June 2022.
However, the project also intended to address the longer-term goals of the
construction industry which are to:
1. Mobilize, create and manage a pool of skilled workforce,
2. Promote the sector as an attractive avenue for employment, and
3. Design/develop attractive incentives to attract and retain workforce in
the sector.
The project had three components: Providing skilling, reskilling and upskilling
opportunities leading to national certification in construction trades (Department
of Technical Education); engagement support to individuals in the construction
sector (DoEE); and the formation of Specialized Firms in construction
occupations and provided support such as tools and equipment, wage top-up,
outsourcing work and also facilitated creation of a conducive policy environment
(DoEE).
Status as of date
There are 54 established Specialized Firms (SF) under the Build Bhutan Project.
Over the past one year, the specialized firms, Hydropower sector and private
construction firms have engaged 356 individuals. Although, the Project ended on
30th June, 2022, support for the candidates will continue till they complete the
one-year contract.

Chapter Three
The Entrepreneurship Promotion Division
Entrepreneurship Promotion Division (EPD) works toward promoting the
culture of entrepreneurship in Bhutan. To achieve this the Division focuses on
changing the mindsets and attitudes leading to self-employment through
entrepreneurship development training, organizing events and supporting new
infrastructure in collaboration with the relevant agencies.
In the 12th Plan, the government identified Start up and CSI as one of the
Flagship programs and brought all the key players under one umbrella to expedite
and propel CSI in the country. The government believes that focusing on
promoting innovative and vibrant Startups could contribute to three National
Key Results Areas (NKRAs) of 12th FYP such as:
a) NKRA 2: Economic diversity and productivity enhanced
b) NKRA 3: Poverty Eradicated & In-equality reduced
c) NKRA 11: Productive & Gainful Employment created
Four major outputs have been identified towards achieving the outcome of
creating a vibrant Startup ecosystem to nurture creativity, innovation and
entrepreneurship for gainful self-employment and economic development. The
four outputs are:
Figure 3 Outputs of startup ecosystem
19 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR
EPD Annual Report 2021-22
3.1. Activity 1: Start-up Entrepreneurship Program
3.1.1 Entrepreneurship Courses
Entrepreneurship courses are provided to potential and aspiring entrepreneurs
to stimulate innovative thinking and facilitate them to pursue entrepreneurial
aspirations through appropriate interventions. The course uses CEFE
methodology which CEFE stands for Competency-based Economies, Formation of
Enterprise. The intensive course includes business games, role-plays, simulations,
field visit, business plan preparation and presentation among others as part of
the action learning methodology. The top 4 participants from each course are
provided a cash prize of Nu. 50, 000 and receive facilitation and support services
while pursuing their entrepreneurial aspirations. Entrepreneurship courses
include Basic Entrepreneurship Course (BEC) a 15-day course for aspiring
entrepreneurs with educational qualification equivalent or lower than 12th
standard and Advanced Entrepreneurship Course (AEC) a 21-day course for
aspiring entrepreneurs with educational qualification equivalent to higher than a
bachelor’s degree.
In the Fiscal Year 2021-2022, entrepreneurship course was provided for in 8
dzongkhags (Thimphu, Mongar, Trashigang, Zhemgang, Chukha, Dagana,
Trashi Yangtse, Bumthang, Gasa) in which a total of 713 aspiring entrepreneurs
(326 males and 387 females) participated. The entrepreneurship courses
produced 62 start-ups.
3.1.2 Refresher orientation training on Entrepreneurship Development
Program
The Entrepreneurship and Promotion Division (EPD) and TVET Promotion
Division (TPD) have made a joint visit to the TTIs and IZCs in the last fiscal
year (2020-2021) to conduct a pre-feasibility study to set up Business Incubation
Centers in the Institutes under the Start-up/CSI Flagship Program. During the
visit they also had the opportunity to meet the EDP focal trainers and discussed
the implementation status of entrepreneurship courses in the Institutes. Most of
the focal trainers in the institutes expressed the need to build the capacity of the
trainers and also for Training materials support for effective delivery of the
courses. Another key recommendation of the visits was to provide a brief
orientation workshop and refresher course for the principals and EDP focal
person. Although the division has already conducted TOT for the EDP Focal
Trainers, Principals weren’t orientated on the implementation modality of the
course which is important and necessary for the successful implementation of
the program in the institutes.
20 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR
EPD Annual Report 2021-22
Therefore, the Division organized a brief orientation and a short EDP refresher
course for the principals and EDP focal trainers from 9-13th August 2021 at
Bumthang. The Orientation program will make them aware about
entrepreneurship development process and further enhance their competencies.
The target group of orientation and EDP refresher course are the principals and
EDP focal persons from TTIs, IZCs and related stakeholders.

3.1.3 Entrepreneurship Promotion Fund for schools
The education system rarely exposes the students to entrepreneurship; and
instead prepares them for a job. To combat the conventional thinking of simply
seeking employment, in the 12th FYP under the Startup/CSI Flagship Program
2018-2023, the Ministry targets schools to promote entrepreneurship at the
grassroots level.
In this effort, entrepreneurship promotion funds to promote entrepreneurial
activities in the schools were provided for setting up entrepreneurship clubs. The
entrepreneurship clubs have the following objectives:
a. Promote entrepreneurship activities in the school
b. To foster and nurture robust entrepreneurship culture in the schools
c. To build a vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem within schools
Nu. 100,000 per school was disbursed among 56 Schools (53 Schools offering
Business and Entrepreneurship subjects, 3 Middle Secondary Schools) to
establish entrepreneurship clubs.
21 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR
EPD Annual Report 2021-22
3.1.4 TOT on New Business Creation (NBC)
The Training of Trainers (TOT) Program on entrepreneurship development is
one of the key activities to promote the culture of entrepreneurship in Bhutan
through the capacity building of important stakeholders. In this financial year,
Economic Development Officers (EDOs) who spearhead economic
development activities and facilitate business opportunities in the Dzongkhag
and representatives from Organizations Working for Persons with Disabilities
(OPDS) were trained. The National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2019,
Section 9: Economic Security, mandates the Ministry to create an enabling
environment for PWDs to be skilled and employed. A total of 40 (Male-20,
Female-20) individuals were trained under the ToT Program.
3.1.5 Entrepreneurship Education Integration and Entrepreneurship
Education Capacity Development
One of the key initiatives undertaken by the Department was the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Royal Education Council and
Department of School Education on February 9, 2021, regarding the integration
of entrepreneurship education in the school curriculum. Along with the financial
assistance, 77 teachers across 75 schools (56 government schools and 19 private
schools) were trained from 24th February to 12th April 2021 on the newly
developed Business and Entrepreneurship curriculum for classes XI and XII.
3.1.6. Micro Work and Online Freelancing Program

3.4 Activity 4: Startup Infrastructure
Infrastructure development is a key driver for progress and a critical enabler for
productivity and sustainable economic growth. It contributes significantly to
human development, poverty reduction and the attainment of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG)s. Under this program, two key initiatives have been
undertaken, namely establishment of 5 Business Incubation Centres and 2 Fab
Labs, in order to boost startups in the country.

EPD Annual Report 2021-22
3.4.1 Fab Lab Establishment
A standard Fab Lab is being established at Jigme Wangchuck Power Training
Institute (JWPTI), and with the remaining equipment due to arrive in October
2022, 75% of the Fablab has been completed. A Bio Fab Lab is being established
at the College of Natural Resources which is expected to be operational by 2023.
The Fab Labs are considered to be one of the integral components of the
ecosystem to enhance and promote innovation.
3.4.2 Business Incubation Manager Recruitment and Salary Support
Business incubation has been identified as a means of meeting a variety of socio-
economic policy needs, which includes job creation, fostering a community's
entrepreneurial climate, technology commercialization, diversifying local
economies, building or accelerating growth of local industry clusters, business
creation and retention, encouraging women entrepreneurship, identifying
potential spin-in or spin-out business opportunities, or community revitalization.
With a view to promote innovation and entrepreneurship development as one of
the themes of development and to bring about a change in the mindset and
enhance the employability of graduates, the MoLHR and RUB signed an MoU
on 18th October 2021. The key activity was to facilitate and support institutional
mechanisms such as the Business Incubation Manager and set up Business
Incubation Centers to enhance coordination of entrepreneurship activities.
Business Incubation Centres (BICs) were established in five Colleges i.e.
Sherubtse College, College of Science and Technology, Jigme Namgyel
Engineering College, Gedu College of Business Studies and College of Natural
Resources. In line with the report produced by the World Bank and based on a
study carried out on business incubation centres, MoLHR proposed dedicated
staffing of the BICs to make its operation more effective. It was shared that
without a dedicated staff the operation of Business Incubation Centres would
not be effective. Five Business Incubation Managers were appointed in the BICs
for a period of 3 years, after which an assessment would be carried out to
integrate and institutionalize the recruitment in the rest of the relevant Colleges.
The Ministry also assured its support in terms of funding and capacity building.
Additionally, support would also be provided for the following:
● carry out a RUB-wide annual business idea competition,
● support GCBS in developing entrepreneurship related award-bearing
programmes and
31 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR
EPD Annual Report 2021-22
● also partner with RUB (mainly GCBS) to carry out any scholarly works
that may contribute to policy making
Facilitate networking between colleges and relevant industry experts to have
better cross cutting knowledge sharing.
3.4.3 Digital Job Challenge
To give digitally skilled young people, working or aspiring to work in the digital
jobs space a boost, 21 applicants, selected for Digital Jobs Innovation Challenge
fund received the awards in the form of various IT gadgets and upskilling
programs. The challenge was jointly organized by the Ministry of Labour and
Human Resources, Gross National Happiness Commission, Thimphu TechPark
Limited and UNDP Bhutan.
The digital job challenge is also one of the key activities that came out in the
Digital Jobs in Bhutan Report. The report states that attracting global talent
and investors in small and medium-sized Business Process Outsourcing (BPOs)
Type text here
and Information Technology Outsourcing (ITOs) is the way forward for demand
creation in ICT jobs. Supporting homegrown BPO and ITOs for long-term
sustainability is the next step. To build a strong homegrown ICT sector in the
country, it is important that young people gain experience working in the ICT
and ICT-related sectors. It is also vital to support young people with digital skills
to find employment.
Within a week, the organizers received over 100 applications. The applicants
were young people between the age of 18-35 years, who had digital skills and
were looking to get self-employed, freelance or create digital jobs. The award, of
up to USD 2,000 was given in the form of hardware, software or scholarship for
upskilling through international certification programs. They bring in diverse and
innovative ideas of using the digital platform to self-employ or create jobs
through digital art and cryptocurrency, virtual reality and tourism, graphics
designing, 3D animation and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT).
The award recipients also, as part of the challenge, received mentoring from
industry experts, both national and international. A monthly check-in will also
keep the awardees updated with each other, to keep track and to share
experiences.

Chapter Four
The Information and Career Guidance Unit
Background
The Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship with its mandate to
provide gainful and productive employment also must ensure as its final product
that the right information is dissimilated to everyone to enable people and youth
to make informed career choices when they enter the job market. The
Organizational Development Report 2019 also indicated a lack of career
counseling services in the Ministry. The report recommended the creation of a
pool of occupational psychologists and career counseling professionals. The
importance of such counseling service is felt more than ever owing to the
growing demand of the labour market to match jobs and aspirations of the job
seekers which is why the unit will add value to the current work that the
department is doing. The unit is tasked with the most important job since it is
the first contact point for the job seekers coming to avail services from DoEE.
Unlike the career education and guidance provided in educational institutions,
which should be oriented towards making further educational choices, the ICGU
under the DoEE is more directly focused on employment counselling, job-search
assistance, and job placement which is why it has become an integral component
under the Department of Employment & Entrepreneurship cushioning against
the shocks of the labour market demands when students transition from school
to work.
GOWA
GOWA- connecting talents with the labour market is an information
dissemination platform followed by on-the-spot recruitment by potential
employers. The GOWA forum was first piloted on 29th September, 2021. Since
then, the forum has been replicated by the Regional Offices, taking it to rural
communities of the country. Besides, the regular program package, the Regional
Offices and the Head office has been constantly brining creative ideas to enhance
the benefit of the program. This includes taking the GOWA to the local
government, parents, SDP graduates product display, on-the-spot recruitment
among others.
Upcoming activities of the Unit
• The unit is currently drafting a Strategy on Career guidance
36 Department of Employment and Entrepreneurship, MoLHR
ICGU Annual Report 2021-22
• The unit is also planning to develop a career playbook
• Update the Career and Occupation Dictionary, 2012

Employment Responsibility System (ERS)
The Employment Responsibility System is aimed at promoting shared
responsibilities in employment generation and ensure effective coordination
among key agencies in facilitating gainful and productive employment the
country.
It clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities for various
ministries/departments and other key agencies involved in employment related
activities. It also provides a platform for collaborative policy interventions
planning and implementation.

Phuentsholing was the hardest hit district due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Owing to frequent lockdowns, most of the private sectors remained
nonoperational. Thus, the number of youth availing the YELP program has
drastically reduced particularly in Phuentsholing Region unlike previous years.
The office carried out, monitoring of the YELP engaged youth prior to lockdown
as well as post lockdown.

National Education Profile
2018 Update
OVERVIEW
In Bhutan, the academic year begins in February and ends in December, and the official primary school entrance age is 6. The system is structured so that the primary school cycle lasts 7 years, lower
secondary lasts 4 years, and upper secondary lasts 2 years. Bhutan has a total of 170,000 pupils enrolled in primary and secondary education. Of these pupils, about 94,000 (56%) are enrolled in primary
education. Figure 3 shows the highest level of education reached by youth ages 15-24 in Bhutan. Although youth in this age group may still be in school and working towards their educational goals, it is
notable that approximately 26% of youth have no formal education and 13% of youth have attained at most incomplete primary education, meaning that in total 39% of 15-24 year olds have not
completed primary education in Bhutan.

SCHOOL PARTICIPATION AND EFFICIENCY
The percentage of out of school children in a country shows what proportion of children are not currently participating in the education system and who are, therefore, missing out on the benefits of
school. Figure 5 looks at the percentage of youth of secondary school ages who are out of school in Bhutan. Nearly 26% of female youth of secondary school age are out of school compared to 27% of
male youth of the same age. For youth of secondary school age, the biggest disparity can be seen between the poorest and the richest youth.

Figures 6 and 7 look at indicators of participation, completion, and progression in the education system. Figure 6 displays gross indicators (which include under- and over-age students) and net indicators
(which include only on-time students of official school age) for student intake, participation, and flows. In Bhutan, the gross enrollment rate in primary education is 93% for both girls and boys combined.
This increases to 95% in lower secondary, with a student transition rate to secondary school of 100%. In Bhutan, the primary net enrollment rate is 80% and the primary completion rate is 95%. Both of
these indicators provide a sense of the progress a country is making towards universal primary education -- a key UN Millenium Development Goal -- and, for Bhutan, suggest that the country has yet to
achieve universal primary education. Figure 7 displays the repetition rate in primary education, showing the specific grades in which students are more likely to repeat. It suggests that of the first 5
grades of primary in Bhutan, students are more likely to repeat grade 5. The repetition rate in grade 5 is 9.3% (for both males and females), which is 4.7 points higher than the average repetition rate
across primary grades of 4.6%.

LEARNING
This section provides information on indicators of learning, which lend insight into the FIG8. COMPARISON OF ACCESS AND LITERACY
quality of educational provision. In this profile, learning is measured through literacy
100
rates, which are important because literacy is a foundational skill needed to attain 66 th percentile
higher levels of learning, and national performance on learning assessments. Figure 8
demonstrates where Bhutan stands in comparison to other low and middle income
countries in access to education, measured as the primary school net enrollment rate,
and youth literacy. Compared to other countries, Bhutan ranks at the 19 percentile in 33rd percentile
access and at the 36 percentile in learning. Figure 9 compares youth and adult literacy
rates and shows that, in Bhutan, the literacy rate is 87% among the youth population; 75
this is lower than the average youth literacy rate in other lower middle income
countries. ycaretiL)htuoY( O Bhth ue tar ncountries

EDUCATION EXPENDITURE
Figures 11 and 12 compare Bhutan's per pupil expenditure (PPE) and pupil teacher ratio (PTR), where data is available, to those of other lower middle income countries. PPE indicates a country's
commitment to education at each school level. In Bhutan, PPE in primary education as a percentage of GDP per capita is 14%, higher than the median PPE in primary for lower middle income countries,
which is 13%. In Bhutan, the PPE in primary is lower than the PPE in secondary. PTR is a proxy learning quality and resource availability indicator. In Bhutan, the PTR in primary education is 34.6, meaning
that on average there is one teacher for every 34.6 primary school students. This is higher than the median PTR in primary for lower middle income countries, which is 27. In Bhutan, the PTR in primary is
higher than the PTR in secondary.

DATA TABLE
In this table, the values of different education indicators for Bhutan are compared to all countries, to South Asia, and to low and middle income countries. The percentile rank that is given indicates
Bhutan's standing relative to these country groups. A higher percentile rank indicates better relative performance than a lower percentile rank. Percentile rankings above 66% are considered high and
colored in green, rankings between 33% and 66% are considered average and colored in yellow, and rankings below 33% are considered low and colored in red. For example, the gross enrollment rate
for females in primary education in Bhutan is 93%. For this indicator, Bhutan ranks in the 16 percentile relative to all countries, meaning that 16% of countries have lower gross enrollment rates than
Bhutan. As another example, the survival rate to grade 5 of primary school for males in Bhutan is 93%, and Bhutan ranks in the 54 percentile relative to all countries, in the 66 percentile relative to South
Asia, and in the 67 percentile relative to low and middle income countries for this indicator.

FOREWORD
The Ministry of Labour and Human Resources is pleased to bring out the
fourth edition of the Regulation on Working Conditions as empowered by
Section 234 of the Labour and Employment Act of Bhutan 2007. This
Regulation pertaining to employment conditions is necessary to implement
the provisions of the Act effectively.
The Regulation is the outcome of the tripartite dialogues held amongst the
Royal Government, Employers and Employees across the country. As such,
every provision of the Regulation enjoys the consensus of all parties in the
labour market and is legally enforceable.
The main thrust of the revision efforts has been to incorporate and adopt
international best practices in labour administration as well as updating
them in line with the changes in relevant national laws. With the
implementation of this Regulation, all the provisions of the Labour and
Employment Act of Bhutan 2007 will be in full enforcement.
The Regulation should benefit both the employers and employees. More
importantly, they are expected to enhance the employment conditions to a
new height, especially in the private and corporate sectors, ultimately
realizing the national vision of productive, harmonious and happy working
relationships between the employers and employees.
May there be a fair and just labour administration system, and may the
Bhutanese people enjoy the full benefits of such an enlightened system.
(Karma Dorji)
Minister

Background
The development experience of Bhutan is unusual in that its present
infrastructure was built up from a tiny base in less than forty years. Prior
to the early 1960s, Bhutan was isolated from the rest of the world, and its
dispersed population was entirely dependent upon subsistence agriculture.
Since first embarking upon a process of modernization in the early 1960s,
Bhutan has made great progress in improving the standard of living of its
people. It has a 1991 population of 600,000. The RGOB's development
strategy has focused on striking a balance between, on the one hand, growth
in productivity and incomes, and on the other hand, a desire to preserve its
cultural and environmental heritage. A major emphasis will be on further
development of human resources, the provision of basic services to both urban
and rural communities, balanced development among regions, and
decentralization and community participation. On the basis of its
development strategy articulated in its five-year plans, the latest being the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), Bhutan has attracted very substantial
donor support to finance its physical infrastructure. At the same time, it
has improved education and health services which have greatly improved social
indicators across the board.
Although by international standards, Bhutan's urban centers are comparatively
small, both in population and land coverage, urban development is an
important component of this development strategy. About 15% (90,000) of the
1991 national population is classified as urban. Of these, about two-thirds
of the urban population reside in Thimphu and Phuntsholing. Although
official figures on urban growth rates are not readily available, there are
indications of increases in the order of 5 to 10% per annum, with reliable
data for Thimphu recording a doubling of population over the last ten years.
With almost 85% of its population still residing in rural areas, Bhutan faces
the challenge of continuing rapid urbanization as the labor force continues
to exceed the demand for agricultural labor and as primary education spreads

rapidly and job expectations rise concomitantly, the government is confronted
with the issue of how to create employment for the rapidly growing labor
force outside the agricultural sector; and how to manage the urbanization
that will accelerate as the demand for non-agricultural jobs grows.
Since it is likely that much of future population growth will be concentrated
in urban areas, the government is placing more importance on the urban sector
than ever before. In addition to Thimphu and Phuntsholing, agglomeration
economies are starting on a modest scale in district centers. Despite their
small size, these towns cand evelop further because of the enermous efforts
involved in travel from one place to another. In this sense, Bhutam is a
series of small regional economies, whose linkages with each other are
improving; however, in the near term, the cost of transactions between one
region and another will remain very high. The government is interested in
promoting the growth of these regional economies as part of its policy of
balanced regional growth. District centers will play a key role in this
effort.
With this in mind, the project will seek to support RGoB's policy of balanced
regional growth and to provide essential services to the residents of these
urban centers. To achieve this objective, the strategic decision was made to
strengthen the institutional, technical and financial capacity of selected
urban centers, and to improve the coverage and quality of urban services.
Objectives
The objective of the project is to assist the Royal Government of Bhutan
(RGOB) in managing the urban development process by improving the delivery of
high priority urban infrastructure services in urban centers outside Thimphu
and Phuntsholing. This objective supports the RGOB's policy of balanced
regional development and decentralization. Achievement of this objective
will be measured in terms of the following key performance indicators: (a)
measurable improvements in the management of urban centers, including
increase in the number of trained personnel at the district level to
implement urban development plans, and to operate and maintain infrastructure
investments; existence of a functioning financial management, budgeting and
accounting systems; application of modern land management tools, increased
effectiveness of urban investments, etc; and (b) improved coverage and
quality of basic urban services (e.g., water supply and low-cost sanitation,
solid waste management, roads, river bank protection, retaining walls and
storm water drainage, and more efficient organization of civic space
(including parking). Specific performance targets and service levels will be
determined during preparation.
Description
The project will have two major components. The institutional development
component will focus at the district level. It will seek to build up capacity
in the effective implementation of urban plans and investment programs, and
on proper and timely operation and maintenance of infrastructure investments.
It will also seek to increase the participation of informal municipal
committees, where they exists. Finally, this component will also support
studies to strengthen the institutional and financial base of selected urban
centers.

The second component of the project will consist of physical investments in
selected urban centers identified as potential growth areas in the RGoB
Eighth Five-Year Plan. Investments would include: water supply, low-cost
sanitation, solid waste management, roads, stormwater drains, retaining walls
and river embankment protection, minor infrastructure improvements (e.g.
footpaths, street improvements), and more efficient and better designed
organization of civic space.
Financing
Total project cost is estimated to be about $14.5 million, of which the Bank
credit would cover an estimated $12 million. Potential co-financing of $0.5
million is expected from UNDP/UNCHS for technical assistance.
Implementation
The estimated project implementation period is five years. The Urban
Development and Housing Division within the Ministry of Communications would
be responsible for overall project oversight, while implementation at the
district level will be done with the district administrative and block
offices. A separate unit, responsible for the O&M of investments at the
district level, is proposed, which would be staffed with suitably trained
technical staff with adequate supply and equipment.
Benefits, Sustainability and Risks
Benefits:
The population living in the selected urban centers would benefit from better
urban and land use management, and improved provision of urban services and
infrastructure (water supply, sanitation, roads, stormwater drainage,
retaining walls and river embankment protection, solid waste management, and
other essential civic amenities). Government agencies, such as the Urban
Development and Housing Division of the Ministry of Communications and the
district engineering cells, would also benefit from technical assistance to
strengthen their planning, and O&M capacities. Training programs will be
coordinated with existing institutions
Sustainability:
[Note: Flag the factors critical for the sustainability of project
benefits.]Continuing commitment to a policy of balanced regional development
and decentralization will be essential to the success of the project.
Risks:
Success of the project will depend on RGoB's continuing commitment to its
urban development policy. There are strong indications that the Government
will sustain its support for decentralization and balanced regional
development/. Another risk to the project is the adequacy of trained
personnel at the central and district levels. The issue is not so much the
low levels of training, as it is the actual number of trained staff. In
general, existing staff although short in number are of high calibre.
Finally, on the cost recovery aspect, continued consultations with the public
combined with cost affordability analysis will be necessary to frame a
sustainable cost recovery policy within the project which would support
RGoB's policy of increasing self-financing for urban investments.

Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations
This would be the first World Bank-assisted urban development project in
Bhutan. However, Bank experience with project implementation has been
excellent, on account of very strong Government ownership and commitment to
effective project implementation, and good collaboration with co-financiers,
notably the Swiss Development Corporation. The portfolio currently consists
of two projects, the third Forestry Credit, for which implementation remains
satisfactory, and the Second Education Credit. The recently closed First
Education Project and GEF Environment Trust fund were also fully
satisfactory, although the education project had to be extended by 18 months
because of delays in school construction during the project's first few
years. Both projects met or surpassed their major benchmarks, with the
exception of teacher training candidates on account of a shortage of
applicants up to 1994. The Environment Trust Fund even met its conservation
benchmarks in three years rather than the anticipated five.
There are also lessons to be learned from urban projects in countries,
experiencing a similar low level of urbanization and weak institutional
capacity. These are the need to: (a) keep the project simple in terms of
design, scope and institutional arrangements; (b) emphasize the importance of
combining capacity building and investments; and (c) set out modest goals
which can be achieved within existing constraints. These have been considered
in the design of the project.
The experience from the DANIDA water supply and sanitation project in Thimphu
and Phuntsholing demonstrate the feasibility of cost recovery for O&M in
water supply. These projects introduced meters, a good pricing structure,
and most important, separate water accounts so that the little subsidy given
is not hidden. The sets an important precedent for other urban centers.

Bank and other development agencies.]The The
Environmental and Social Aspects
Social:
Social assessments will be carried out during project preparation, in which
collaboration with local social scientists would be encouraged and welcome.
Environmental:
The project category is B. The urban environmental issues are well known and
rather straightforward in the context of Bhutan's small towns. The National
Environmental Commission (NEC) and RGOB have agreed to prepare simple, easy
to implement codes of practice on sanitation and solid waste management. In
addition, the project consultants are preparing a detailed EA which includes
a summary sectoral assessment.
Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) is putting in place an adequate legal
framework for Environmental Management and Assessment. In December 1998, NEC
issued Bhutan's National Environmental Startegy (an impressive document)
aimed for guiding sustainable development in Bhutan. NEC has approved, in
February 1999, an Environmental Assessment Process (EAP) which comprises an
- 4 -
environmental assessment manual and sectoral guidelines for the six main
development sectors; the guidelines include roads and highways, while the
urban sector will be taken up in the future. This has been approved by RGOB
and makes the EAP now obligatory. NEC further plans to introduce an
Environmental Act for approval by Parliament in July 1999. NEC has highly
competent key staff and is developing its institutional capacity further.
The project will assist this capacity building through preparation of simple
(environmental) codes of practice for the urban development and for the roads
sectors. Draft TORs for developing these codes and also for providing
training to NEC and sectoral staff during the project have been agreed with
RGOB.
No major resettlement is envisaged under the project.

ANNEX
Because this is a Category B project, it may be required that the borrower
prepare a separate EA report. If a separate EA report is required, once it
is prepared and submitted to the Bank, in accordance with OP 4.01,
Environmental Assessment, it will be filed as an annex to the Public
Information Document (PID) .
If no separate EA report is required, the PID will not contain an EA annex;
the findings and recommendations of the EA will be reflected in the body of
the PID.
