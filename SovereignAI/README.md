# SovereignAI Update Log

## 📜 Update History

* **Initial Upload:**
  The first Python notebook file uploaded was an **incomplete and outdated version** of our work. This version was mistakenly pushed to the repository.

* **Final Upload:**
  The **correct, completed notebook** was pushed later. We confirm that **no changes were made after the official submission deadline.** This final notebook was always intended to be the primary version for this repository.
