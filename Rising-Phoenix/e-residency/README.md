A comprehensive digital identity and e-residency platform for the Kingdom of Bhutan, powered by **Sovio Digital Identity** technology. This Next.js application enables global entrepreneurs to become e-residents of Bhutan and access a full suite of digital government services.

> We initially tried to selfhost **[Credebl](https://github.com/credebl)** which is officially implemented by **Royal Government of Bhutan** for **National ID**. But we had difficulties so we went with **[sovio.id](https://sovio.id).**

## 💡 Strategic Business Model: Why This Works Brilliantly for Bhutan

### 🌟 **The Small Nation, Big Impact Strategy**
Bhutan's E-Residency program represents a masterclass in digital nation-building - leveraging technology to punch far above its geographic and population weight.

### 💰 **Revenue Generation with Minimal Infrastructure**
- **Pure Digital Revenue**: E-residents pay registration fees, annual renewals, and service charges with zero physical infrastructure required
- **Scalable Income Stream**: Each new e-resident generates recurring revenue without proportional cost increases
- **Tax Revenue from Digital Nomads**: Special tax incentives attract high-earning remote workers who contribute to Bhutan's treasury
- **Service Fee Ecosystem**: Banking, business registration, and compliance services generate ongoing revenue streams

### 🛡️ **Low Risk, High Reward Model**
- **Minimal Fraud Exposure**: Digital identities are blockchain-verified through Sovio - traditional identity fraud becomes nearly impossible
- **No Physical Assets at Risk**: Unlike traditional business incentive programs, there's no real estate, equipment, or infrastructure that can be damaged or misused  
- **Self-Sustaining Operations**: Platform runs on modern cloud infrastructure with predictable, low operational costs
- **Automated Compliance**: Digital processes reduce human error and administrative overhead

### 🌍 **Unprecedented Soft Power & Global Recognition**
- **International Reference Model**: Major economies like Singapore, UAE, and EU nations are already studying Bhutan's approach
- **Tech Innovation Leadership**: Positions Bhutan as a forward-thinking digital pioneer, attracting international partnerships and investment
- **David vs. Goliath Story**: Global media fascination with a tiny Himalayan kingdom leading digital transformation
- **Diplomatic Capital**: Enhanced international standing through innovative governance and sustainable business practices

### 🚀 **The "Wow Factor" Advantage**
- **First-Mover in Happiness-Based Governance**: Combining Gross National Happiness with digital residency creates a unique value proposition
- **Size as a Feature, Not a Bug**: Bhutan's small scale allows for rapid iteration, policy testing, and personalized service that large nations cannot match
- **Sustainable Development Model**: Aligns with Bhutan's carbon-negative status and environmental leadership, attracting ESG-conscious businesses
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Genuine integration of Buddhist values and modern technology resonates with global entrepreneurs seeking meaningful business environments

### 📈 **Exponential Growth Potential**
With minimal marginal costs per new e-resident and unlimited digital capacity, this model can scale from thousands to millions of participants while maintaining Bhutan's core values and environmental commitments.
