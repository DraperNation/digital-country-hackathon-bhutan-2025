## 🛑 Problem Statement

**How can we empower global citizens to digitally engage with Bhutan’s government services while preserving cultural identity and ensuring sovereign control?**

* **Bhutan** has an opportunity to become a digital leader by offering **borderless eResidency** and AI-powered government services.
* Current systems lack an accessible, globally integrated **citizenship portal** for non-residents.
* Bhutan’s **unique cultural governance** requires a system that can respond in alignment with Gross National Happiness (GNH) values.

## ✅ Solution Overview: Druk eRes

**Druk eRes** is a unified platform combining a **Bhutanese eResidency portal** with a **Sovereign Agentic AI Assistant** built using cutting-edge agent frameworks.
